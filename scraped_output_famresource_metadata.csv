As he and his family struggled, his despair grew. He wondered if he should give up on his dreams of acting or find a steady job. He turned toSt. JudeThaddeus, the patron saint of hopeless causes. “Show me my way in life,” he vowed to the saint one night in a Detroit church, “and I will build you a shrine.”

Danny’s shrine toSt. JudeThaddeus was originally to be a general children’s hospital located some where in the south. Danny’s mentor, Cardinal Samuel Stritch, recommended he look to Memphis, Tennessee, the cardinal’s hometown.
By 1955 Danny and a group of Memphis businessmen he’d rallied to build the hospital decided it should be more than a general children’s hospital. At the time, the survival rate for childhood cancers was 20%, and for those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) — the most common form of childhood cancer — only 4% of children would live.","{'source_url': 'https://www.stjude.org/about-st-jude/history/how-we-began.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T19:30:06.403157', 'title': 'How St. Jude began - St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital', 'section': 'How St. Jude began - St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital', 'super_section': None}"

The DAISY (Diseases Attacking the Immune SYstem) Award is an international recognition program that honors and celebrates the skillful, compassionate care nurses provide every day. The DAISY Foundation was established by the family of J. Patrick Barnes after he died from complications of the auto-immune disease ITP in 1999. During his hospitalization, they deeply appreciated the care and compassion shown to Patrick and his entire family. When he died, they felt compelled to say ""thank you"" to nurses in a very public way. Please say thank you by sharing your story of how a nurse made a difference you will never forget!
