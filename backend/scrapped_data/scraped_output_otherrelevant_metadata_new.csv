Each of our cells contains over 20,000 genes that interact in complex ways that we are only beginning to understand. Mutations in just a few genes in this thousands-of-genes network lead to a variety of complicated effects within the cell. Further complexity comes because cancer is a disease with many types.

158,"Relaxation is a broad term that describes strategies used to help a child, teen, or young adult relax when going through medical treatment. Certain relaxation techniques can help them cope with the effects of illness. Methods include deep breathing, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation.
Children, teens, and young adults can use these methods almost anywhere. The approach can change based on age. Relaxation can reduce stress and help with side effects like pain, tiredness, and upset stomach.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/integrative-medicine/relaxation-techniques.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:14.893934', 'title': 'Relaxation Techniques in Childhood Cancer - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What are relaxation techniques for children with serious illnesses?', 'super_section': None}"
159,"Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing can help with pain, stress, and treatment side effects.
Relaxation techniques have many benefits. Relaxation can help:
Lower heart rate
Slow breathing
Lower blood pressure
Improve well-being
Research shows relaxation can help with many common problems during treatment, including:
Pain
Stress and anxiety
Depression
Nausea
Fatigue
Sleep problems
Your child can learn to use these methods on their own. This gives them more control and confidence.
Relaxation methods can also help you. Research shows that if you are calm and relaxed, then your child is more likely to be calm and relaxed.
Children learn how to cope from caregivers. As they see you use a positive approach to handle stress and fear, they can learn to deal with stress and fear, too.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/integrative-medicine/relaxation-techniques.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:14.893934', 'title': 'Relaxation Techniques in Childhood Cancer - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Benefits of relaxation', 'super_section': None}"

161,"Breathing exercises help your child use patterns of deep, slow, regular breathing. During stress, breathing is fast and shallow. Heart rate and blood pressure increase. Slow, deep breathing changes brain signals. This helps your child’s mind and body relax.
Breathing techniques can involve breathing in and breathing out while counting to a number. For example: breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, breathe out for 4.
Other methods focus on how the belly and chest move. For example, your child can place a stuffed animal on their belly and watch it rise and fall. Try different deep breathing exercises to see what works best.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/integrative-medicine/relaxation-techniques.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:14.893934', 'title': 'Relaxation Techniques in Childhood Cancer - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Deep breathing', 'super_section': None}"
162,"In guided imagery, your child uses their imagination to create pleasant mental images in as much detail as possible, using all 5 senses. This mental picture often includes an image of a favorite place.
Using the imagination can change heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. Seeing positive images reduces stress and anxiety by creating a mental escape.
Guided imagery may help with:
Worry
Fear
Stress
Anger
Pain
Upset stomach
Sleep problems
Getting through medical tests or procedures
A care provider can lead the guided imagery. Your child can also do the guided imagery on their own. A recording may help guide your child. Music or nature sounds can help them connect to the imagined scenes.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/integrative-medicine/relaxation-techniques.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:14.893934', 'title': 'Relaxation Techniques in Childhood Cancer - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Guided imagery', 'super_section': None}"
163,"In progressive muscle relaxation, your child tenses and releases small groups of muscles, 1 at a time. A care provider will guide your child to do this slowly, in a specific order (from head to toe, for example).
This technique can be combined with deep breathing or guided imagery. Progressive muscle relaxation can help your child become more aware of their body.
One way to make progressive muscle relaxation more real to kids is to assign muscles a color. Tight muscles may be given a red, and the goal is to change them to a calm, relaxing color. Children can choose the color that makes sense to them and imagine the muscles changing color as they release the tension.

Assessments help the care team gather information about how children use their brains. This is called cognitive function.
These effects in childhood cancer survivors often relate to problems in memory or executive function. This set of skills includes self-control, working memory, and mental flexibility.Executive functionrefers to the ability to plan, remember, pay attention, and do several things at once.

Radiation to the belly, spine, or pelvis can increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Childhood cancer survivors who had radiation therapy to the belly, spine, or pelvis should start getting colorectal screenings 5 years after radiation or at age 30, whichever is later.
Eating healthy foods and being physically active may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.

The pituitary, a small gland near the brain, does not make enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). When ACTH is too low, the adrenal glands do not make enough cortisol. This is also known as secondary adrenal insufficiency.
A part of the brain called the hypothalamus does not make enough corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). When CRH is too low, the pituitary gland does not make enough ACTH. When ACTH is too low, the adrenal glands do not make enough cortisol. This is also known as tertiary adrenal insufficiency.

Females have two ovaries. During puberty, the pituitary gland in the brain signals the ovaries to start making more estrogen and progesterone. These are hormones necessary for the reproductive system to work.
Once a month, the ovaries typically release at least 1 egg. If the egg is fertilized by sperm, the female becomes pregnant. If it is not fertilized, the woman will have her menstrual period. This cycle repeats about every 28 days. With each menstrual cycle, the supply of eggs decreases.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/long-term-effects/endocrine-late-effects/female-reproductive-health-issues.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:21.741960', 'title': 'Female Reproductive Problems in Childhood Cancer Survivors - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'How the female reproductive system works', 'super_section': None}"

Breasts in females
Being able to have children
Puberty normally begins between the ages of 8-13 in girls and ages 9-14 in boys. A person’s genetic background influences when puberty begins. The onset of puberty at a young age may run in families.

Middle ear: The middle ear is an air-filled chamber. Inside, 3 small bones called ossicles form a chain that connects the ear drum to the inner ear. These bones are named for their shapes: the malleus (hammer), the incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). Sound waves cause vibrations that travel from the ear drum, to the bones of the middle ear, to the inner ear.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/long-term-effects/hearing-problems.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:24.553945', 'title': 'Hearing Problems in Childhood Cancer Survivors - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Hearing Problems in Childhood Cancer Survivors - Together by St. Jude™', 'super_section': None}"

Stop or prevent pain
Cause loss of consciousness
Relax muscles
Keep patients from moving
Alter or block memory of a procedure
Reduce stress and anxiety
General anesthesia medicines are often given through a vein. Patients will be told not to eat or drink for a period of time before procedures, so families may want to have a snack ready for when the patient wakes up.
The goal of anesthesia is to keep patients safe and comfortable before, during, and after tests and medical procedures.
A doctor trained to give anesthesia and monitor patients is called ananesthesiologist. A nurse who has advanced training in anesthesia is called acertified registered nurse anesthetist(CRNA).","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/procedures/anesthesia.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:29.335892', 'title': 'Anesthesia - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Benefits of anesthesia', 'super_section': None}"

A blood transfusion is a procedure that gives whole blood or blood products (parts of blood) to a patient through a vein. Your child may need a blood transfusion if their body cannot make enough blood cells.
Blood cells develop in the bone marrow, which lies in the center of the bones. Some diseases and treatments can affect the blood or bone marrow and reduce the number of blood cells. These include:
Cancers of the blood, such asleukemiaandlymphoma
Blood disorders, such asanemia,sickle cell disease, and bleeding disorders

The first tube is usually a long tube, but it may be changed for a low-profile device after healing. Sometimes, a low-profile may be placed initially.
Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy is usually done under general anesthesia. The total time for the procedure is usually about 1-2 hours with anesthesia and recovery.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/procedures/feeding-tube-placement-for-enteral-feeding/placement-gastrostomy-g-gastro-jejunostomy-gj-jejunostomy-j-tubes.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:35.539548', 'title': 'Placement of G Tube, J Tube & GJ Tube - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Imagery-guided feeding tube placement', 'super_section': None}"

891,"Medicines can be given around a nerve to lessen pain in that area of the body. One way to do this is to give the medicine as a single injection (shot). This is called a nerve block injection.
Another way is to place a small catheter (tube) about the size of a fishing line along the nerve and connect it to a medicine pump. This is called a nerve block infusion. The pump will give your child a small amount of pain medicine continuously.
Pain is a normal body reaction after surgery.

892,"When your child receives pain medicines by mouth as a pill or through an IV, some of the drug goes to the brain and can cause your child to feel sleepy. With nerve blocks, the drug does not go to the brain. Nerve blocks can control the pain without making your child too sleepy.
It is important to reduce or prevent pain so your child can breathe deeply, get out of bed, and sleep in comfort. Since your child is more alert, he will know right away if he needs more pain medicine. Being alert and having good pain control makes it easier for your child to cough, sit up, and walk after surgery.

893,"An anesthesiologist gives the nerve block injection or places the infusion catheter during surgery after your child is asleep. An anesthesiologist is a doctor who specializes in managing pain.
The catheter goes under the skin. It is taped into place to keep it from coming out by accident. Most children cannot feel the catheter or the medicines.
Local anesthetics (numbing agents), among other medicines, are used for both nerve block injections and infusions.
Most often, the nerve block infusion will remain in place for 2-7 days. At that point, your child will be able to relieve pain by taking medicines by mouth. Your child might also take pain medicines by mouth during the time the nerve block is in place.

Imaging tests show detailed pictures of soft tissues, organs, and bones inside the body.
Doctors called radiologists look at the images and make detailed reports about what they see.
Radiology reports help your health care team diagnose and treat some childhood diseases. Imaging tests done throughout treatment show the medical team how the disease responds to treatment. After treatment, your child has imaging tests as part of follow-up visits to check for any changes.
How you help your child prepare for an imaging test depends on the type of test that is done. Follow all the instructions your care team gives you for the test. This will help your provider get the best possible image of your child’s body.

1212,"A CT scan uses a computer and X-rays to take detailed pictures inside the body.
The scan itself only lasts a few seconds. But it may be repeated if your child needs a test with a contrast agent.  The appointment may only take 10–20 minutes. A longer time will be needed if contrast or general anesthesia is used.
When it is time for the scan, a medical professional called a radiology  technologist will take you and your child into a special area that houses the CT scanner. Achild life specialistmay also be there to help answer questions.
The CT scanner is a big machine shaped like a large donut. It has a special bed, also called a table, in the middle.  This table can move so your child is in the right location for the scan.
The technologist will position your child on the table.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/tests/imaging-tests/computed-tomography-ct.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:50.355704', 'title': 'Computed Tomography (CT) Scan - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What to expect during a CT scan', 'super_section': None}"
1213,"The technologist will position your child on the table.
The technologist may put towels, cushions, or safety belts around your child to keep them in the correct position.
The  technologist will move to an area close by during the test. They will be able to see, hear, and talk to your child during the scan.  Each pediatric center has different policies, but usually a parent is allowed to be in the adjoining room with the technologist.
The CT scan is painless, but some children may feel anxious or have trouble staying still. It can help if you tell your child to pretend to be a statue. Or they can pretend to be asleep. Depending on your child’s age, they may be asked to hold their breath for a moment.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/tests/imaging-tests/computed-tomography-ct.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:50.355704', 'title': 'Computed Tomography (CT) Scan - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What to expect during a CT scan', 'super_section': None}"

1280,"An MIBG scan helps the care team discover whether a certain type of cancer is present, has spread, or is shrinking.
MIBG is a substance that is absorbed by certain types of tumors.
An MIBG scan helps doctors find and diagnose tumors. It can show the spread of cancer inside the body. It can also show when cancer responds to therapy.
An MIBG scan takes place over 2 days.
The scan uses a small amount of a radioactive substance. The test is safe for your child.

Time– Spend as little time as possible near the radiation source.

This process is used to diagnose specific types of cancer by comparing the protein antigens on cancer cells to those found in normal cells. Immunophenotyping includes immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry.
Immunohistochemistry is a process that uses antibodies to determine if specific proteins are present in a sample of tissue. This type of staining helps pathologists recognize abnormal cells under the microscope and can help pathologists establish a diagnosis or identify relapse.

1423,"Flow cytometry is a method of measuring the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. Antibodies are tagged (linked) with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. The measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light. The process is extremely sensitive. It can look at many thousands of cells per second and identify even 1 leukemia cell among thousands of blood cells. Flow cytometry can detect cancer cells that would not be visible under a microscope. This is known as minimal residual disease, which is important in leukemia treatment.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/tests/laboratory-tests.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:49:59.574802', 'title': 'Laboratory Tests in Childhood Cancer - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Types of laboratory tests', 'super_section': None}"

Doctors can test genes in two general ways:
One gene at a time:This method is used when the doctor knows your child will need a certain medicine that is affected by that gene.
Many genes at a time:This method tests for several genes that can affect different medicines that your child might need.

Each person has a different combination of HLA markers. They are determined bygenes, which are inherited, or passed down from parents to children. So, family members may have similar HLA types. Since children inherit one set of HLA markers from each parent, parents are always a half match to their children.
HLA typing is an important first step of testing before anallogeneic stem cell (bone marrow) transplant.

1575,"Finding a good match for a transplant may be challenging. There are many HLA types.
Your care team may ask that family members be tested to see if they are a good match for your child. This could include biological parents, full siblings, and half-siblings. Donors must be a good match, willing to donate, and able to travel if needed.
If no relatives are a good match, the donor cells may come from a volunteer donor who is well matched. Unrelated donors are sometimes found throughNMDP(formerly known as the National Marrow Donor Program and Be the Match).
There are 3 different types of matches for a transplant:
Full match:The patient and the donor have the same HLA markers.

Haploidentical match (half match):If the patient and the donor share half of the same HLA markers, this is a haploidentical or “haplo” match. Parents are always a half match for their child.
The better the match, the higher the chance for a successful transplant and the lower the risk of complications. With advances in transplant methods, mismatched donor transplants are fairly common, and many are successful.
Several factors can increase the likelihood of finding a good HLA match for a transplant:
Siblings with the same biological parents:Full brothers and sisters have the highest chance (about 1 in 4) of being a full HLA match because they inherit HLA markers from both parents.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/treatment-tests-procedures/tests/hla-typing.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:09.335358', 'title': 'HLA Typing - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Finding an HLA match', 'super_section': None}"

Participation in donor registries:The more people who register as donors—especially from diverse backgrounds—the higher the chance of finding a match for patients who need a transplant.

1735,"Because immune cells can circulate throughout the body, immunotherapy may also help to kill cancer cells that have spread away from the main tumor. Another potential benefit of using the immune system to treat cancer is that some immune cells can develop a “memory” response. T cells learn to attack specific antigens and can remember that antigen if it comes back. The T cells can then respond more quickly when it sees that type of antigen again. This immune system memory is particularly promising in prevention of cancer relapse.
Immunotherapy is an emerging area of research in childhood cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are studying the use of immunotherapy in several pediatric cancers.

Just because a person is on the medical team doesn’t mean they need to know personal details unrelated to patient care. It is also natural to be closer to certain care team members compared to others.
Communicate honestly. Health providers should respect patient and family boundaries. Part of respect and empathy is following the other person’s lead in familiarity and communication. However, if something makes you uncomfortable, tell the person directly. If you don’t feel comfortable speaking with the person, let another team member or hospital representative know.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/care-team/maintaining-healthy-boundaries.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:23.001047', 'title': 'Maintaining Healthy Boundaries With Families and Care Teams - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Ways families can encourage healthy boundaries', 'super_section': None}"

Teach children how to set boundaries in age-appropriate ways. Patients can learn to advocate for themselves. As much as possible, give children control over boundaries in their relationships. This can include setting limits on sharing personal information or physical touch and respecting personal space.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/care-team/maintaining-healthy-boundaries.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:23.001047', 'title': 'Maintaining Healthy Boundaries With Families and Care Teams - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Ways families can encourage healthy boundaries', 'super_section': None}"

Have trouble sucking or swallowing normally
Have trouble gaining or maintaining weight
Have trouble taking medicine by mouth
Need fluids for hydration
Tube feeding, orenteral nutrition, provides nutrition in liquid or formula form through a tube placed into the stomach orintestine. Some medicines may also be given through the feeding tube.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/clinical-nutrition/feeding-tubes-for-nutrition-support.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:43.126578', 'title': 'Feeding Tubes for Nutrition Support - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is a feeding tube?', 'super_section': None}"
2427,"There are generally two ways feeding tubes are placed:
Through the nose (non-surgical)
Through a small cut or incision in the abdomen (surgical)
The type of feeding tube your child has depends on how the tube is placed (through the nose or abdomen) and where the tube ends in the digestive system (stomach or intestine).","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/clinical-nutrition/feeding-tubes-for-nutrition-support.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:43.126578', 'title': 'Feeding Tubes for Nutrition Support - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is a feeding tube?', 'super_section': None}"
2428,"Nasal tubes include:
Nasogastric (NG) tubes
Nasoduodenal (ND) tubes
Nasojejunal (NJ) tubes
An NG tube is inserted through the nose and down the throat into the stomach. ND and NJ tubes end in the small intestine.
A nasogastric tube (NG tube) can be used to give nutrition support (enteral nutrition).
Nasal feeding tubes are generally used when tube feeding is needed for a relatively short time. The tube extends out from one nostril and is secured to the skin using medical tape. They have several advantages including lower risk of infection and ease of placement.
But the tube must be taped to the face. This may bother some children. Other children may have problems with nasal tubes because of irritation of the skin and mucous membranes due to chemotherapy or other treatments.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/clinical-nutrition/feeding-tubes-for-nutrition-support.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:43.126578', 'title': 'Feeding Tubes for Nutrition Support - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Nasal feeding tubes', 'super_section': None}"
2429,"Some feeding tubes are placed through a surgery to make a small opening in the wall of the abdomen.
Surgically placed feeding tubes include:
Gastrostomy (G) tubes
Gastro-jejunostomy (GJ) tubes
Jejunostomy (J) tubes
Surgically placed feeding tubes include G-tubes, J-tubes, and G-J tubes.
Surgically placed tubes (G-tube, J-tube, GJ-tube) are used for a longer time or if a child is not able to have a nasal tube. The opening on the abdomen where the tube is placed is called a stoma. On the outside of the body, patients have a long tube or a “button” or low-profile tube. Once healed, the stoma should not be painful. Children should be able to do most regular activities.

Your child’s activity level
How well your child’s digestive system works
How long your child will need nutrition support
How often the feeding tube will be used
How much care is needed to maintain the feeding tube

Look at the centimeter marking at the base of your child’s nostril. Make sure that the marking is in the same place before using the tube.
You can also check for NG tube placement by pulling back on the plunger of the syringe. If stomach contents come back into the NG tube, the placement is correct.

2538,"Parenteral nutrition (PN) is intravenous (IV) nutrition given through acatheterplaced in a vein. It is used when the patient is not able to get all thenutrientsthey need by mouth or byenteral (tube) feeding. Parenteral nutrition is given as a liquid solution directly into the blood stream. It provides thecaloriesand nutrients that a patient needs.
Parenteral nutrition may be used for partial or complete nutrition support. Complete nutrition support is known as total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
Different types of IV catheters can be used for parenteral nutrition. These include:
Peripheral venous catheter. For short-term parenteral nutrition, a catheter can be placed into a vein located in the arm. This is often called an IV or peripheral IV.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/clinical-nutrition/parenteral-nutrition.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:46.939772', 'title': 'Parenteral Nutrition - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is parenteral nutrition?', 'super_section': None}"
2539,"Central venous catheter. A catheter can be inserted by a surgeon into a large vein that leads to the heart. Central venous catheters include PICC lines, central lines, and ports. Many children have a central venous catheter for cancer treatments, and they can receive nutrition through alumenattached to the catheter. Central venous catheters are preferred for long-term parenteral nutrition.
When possible, it is best to provide nutrition by mouth or tube feeding. These methods allowdigestionto occur in a more natural way. In children with cancer, this is not always possible. Parenteral nutrition may be needed when:
The child’sdigestive systemis not working properly to absorb nutrients.

2542,"Proteins are important to, build muscle, repair tissue, fight infection, and allow cells to function. Protein also provides calories to fuel the body. Proteins are made of amino acids. Some amino acids can be made by the body, but others must come from the diet.
Fats (lipids) provide calories and energy and are used for a variety of cell functions. Fats provided in PN are important to preventessential fatty acid deficiency. Fats serve to protect organs of the body, help to maintain body heat, and store certain vitamins so that they can be absorbed by the body.
PN also provides:
Electrolytes, which are critical to bone, nerve, organ, and muscle function. Electrolytes that may be included in TPN are calcium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, chloride, and acetate.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/clinical-nutrition/parenteral-nutrition.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:46.939772', 'title': 'Parenteral Nutrition - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Nutrients in the parenteral nutrition solution', 'super_section': None}"

2544,"Parenteral nutrition is usually started in the hospital. A doctor, pharmacist, and registered dietitian work together to determine how many calories and other nutrients the patient needs each day. Blood tests are used to monitor response to PN. The PN mixture is adjusted as needed.
Usually, patients receive one bag of PN solution per day. PN comes in 2-in-1 (dextrose and amino acids) and 3-in-1 (dextrose, amino acids, and lipids) solutions. If the solution contains lipids, the bag will have separate chambers. The nutrients need to be mixed together by removing the dividing strip and gently kneading right before infusion. The solution is given by connecting the bag to the patient’s IV or central line and using an infusion pump. The pump is set to give the solution on a specific schedule.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/clinical-nutrition/parenteral-nutrition.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:46.939772', 'title': 'Parenteral Nutrition - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'How parenteral nutrition is given', 'super_section': None}"
2545,"Continuous PNis given all the time. This method is used when PN is first started. This allows the body to adjust to make sure that nutrition needs are met.
Cycled PNis given over specific time periods for less than 24 hours in a day. The pump is set to give PN on a cycle for a set number of hours, such as 20, 16, or 12 hours. As the cycle time is decreased, the rate of infusion is increased so that the overall PN is constant.
Benefits of cycled PN:
The patient gets to have time off the pump to move and participate in activities more easily.
Cycled PN can allow feelings of hunger. Continuous PN prevents hunger which can make it harder to transition to oral feeding.
Cycled PN can promote a more natural hormone response that occurs with meals.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/clinical-nutrition/parenteral-nutrition.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:46.939772', 'title': 'Parenteral Nutrition - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'How parenteral nutrition is given', 'super_section': None}"

2548,"A common problem with PN ishyperglycemia, or high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia can occur when the body cannot use glucose well enough and blood glucose levels rise above normal. This may happen when PN is given too quickly so the body cannot process the sugar. It can also be caused by an infection or a medicine such as a steroid. Symptoms of hyperglycemia include headache, feeling thirsty, weak, or nausea. To prevent problems such as hyperglycemia, the amount of carbohydrate (dextrose) in PN is increased gradually over several days.Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is less common but can occur if PN is stopped suddenly.
Monitoring during PN may include tests to measure:
Levels of glucose in the blood or urine

Feeding tubes differ based on how the tube is inserted (through the nose or abdomen) and where the tube ends in the digestive system (stomach or intestine). If possible, the tube is placed in the stomach for more normal digestion.

2673,"DeductibleFor private insurance, the annual deductible is the amount paid each year before the insurance company starts paying its share of the costs.
If the deductible for the plan is $1,000, the individual or family must pay $1,000 in health care expenses during the plan year before the insurance company will begin covering its share.
In most plans, preventive care services are covered at 100% and do not require the family to meet the annual deductible prior to receiving preventive care.
Co-payA co-pay, or co-payment, is the fixed amount paid at each visit to a care provider or for each prescription filled. Not all plans require co-pays. Co-pays may vary for primary care visits, specialty visits, or type of prescription filled.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/health-insurance-terms.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:54.518998', 'title': 'Common Health Insurance Terms - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Common Health Insurance Terms - Together by St. Jude™', 'super_section': None}"
2674,"Preventive services are usually paid at 100% and do not require a co-pay.
Typically, co-pays do not count towards the annual deductible but are included in the out-of-pocket maximums.
According to a 2017 Kaiser Family Foundation report, the average co-pays are $25 for primary care office visits and $38 for specialty care office visits.
Co-insuranceThe co-insurance is the percentage paid for certain medical expenses after the deductible is met. An insurance company pays a portion of care expenses. The family is responsible for the remaining amount.
If an MRI costs $1,000, the insurance company may cover 80% or $800.

After the out-of-pocket maximum amount, the insurance company will cover 100% of the covered medical expenses for the remainder of the plan year. The out-of-pockets maximums may be the same or different for the medical and prescription drug coverage depending on the insurance plan.
Plan documentsThese documents include Summary Plan Descriptions (SPD) or Evidence of Coverage (EOC) or Summary of Benefits Coverage (SBC)
The plan documents tell the family about the benefits they are entitled to under the insurance plan, and provide rules on how to use the plan.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/health-insurance-terms.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:54.518998', 'title': 'Common Health Insurance Terms - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Common Health Insurance Terms - Together by St. Jude™', 'super_section': None}"

Review your own plan documents to understand the specific rules of your policy.
In-network providerThe insurance network is the group of doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers that the insurance company contracts with to provide services.

For example, an in-network MRI may be 80% paid as opposed to 40% paid for out-of-network. The annual deductible may also be higher for out-of-network services.
Monthly premiumsA premium is the amount the family pays each month for health coverage.

2750,"Pharmacy insurance can be part of a regular health insurance plan or a separate plan just for medicines. Types of pharmacy insurance include:
Employer-sponsored plans:Many people get health insurance through their jobs. This often includes coverage for prescription medicines. These plans usually cost less because they cover many people.
Individual drug plans:You can buy health insurance with prescription drug coverage. You can get these plans through the Health Insurance Marketplace or directly from insurance companies.

2752,"Under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, plans available through the Health Insurance Marketplace must cover essential health benefits, including prescription drugs. Any plan you buy through the Marketplace will include some level of coverage for medications.
The ACA also allows young adults under age 26 to stay on their parents’ health insurance plan.

2753,"Take your insurance card with you to the pharmacy. Talk to your pharmacist or insurance provider if you have questions about what your plan covers.
Pharmacy insurance plans can be confusing. Here is some information to help you understand how the plans work.
Formulary:A drug formulary is a list of medicines covered by your insurance plan. Medicines are often categorized into tiers. Each tier has different prices. The higher the tier, the more you usually have to pay. Your out-of-pocket cost depends on which tier your medicine is in. Lower-tier drugs cost less, while higher-tier ones cost more.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/understanding-pharmacy-insurance.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:57.086837', 'title': 'Understanding Pharmacy Insurance - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What you need to know about pharmacy insurance plans', 'super_section': None}"
2754,"Prior authorization (PA):Some medicines may require approval from your insurance company before a pharmacy can fill a medication. This means your doctor must provide more information to show the need for the medicine.
Health care provider’s role:Your health care provider must complete the prior authorization process requested by the pharmacy.
Patient's role:Follow up with your health care provider if approval is delayed. Remember, you are your best advocate.
Step therapy:Your insurance plan may require you to try a less expensive medicine before they approve a more expensive one. If the first medicine does not work, your health care provider can ask the insurance provider to cover a different one. This is sometimes called “fail-first therapy.”","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/understanding-pharmacy-insurance.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:57.086837', 'title': 'Understanding Pharmacy Insurance - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What you need to know about pharmacy insurance plans', 'super_section': None}"
2755,"Formulation:Some medicines come in different forms, such as oral (by mouth), topical (on the skin), or injectable. The cost of the medicine may depend on the formulation. Make sure you know which formulation is covered by your plan, which is most cost-effective, and which is right for you.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/understanding-pharmacy-insurance.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:57.086837', 'title': 'Understanding Pharmacy Insurance - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What you need to know about pharmacy insurance plans', 'super_section': None}"
2756,"It is important to understand your pharmacy insurance plan and know what costs you need to cover. These amounts depend on your plan and the type of medicines you need.
Copayments and coinsurance:Many pharmacy insurance plans require you to pay part of the cost of medicines. This might be a copayment (a fixed amount) or coinsurance (a percentage of the medicine's cost).
Deductibles:Some plans have a deductible that you must pay before the insurance starts to cover the costs of your medicines. Once the deductible is met, you will only have to pay the copayment or coinsurance. If your plan has a deductible, your out-of-pocket costs may be higher at the beginning of the year than toward the end. You must pay toward your deductible before a lower copay or coinsurance takes effect.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/understanding-pharmacy-insurance.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:57.086837', 'title': 'Understanding Pharmacy Insurance - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Out-of-pocket costs for medicines', 'super_section': None}"
2757,"Use an approved or in-network pharmacy.
Insurance plans often have a list of preferred or in-network pharmacies where you can get your medicines at a lower cost. Using a non-approved or out-of-network pharmacy may result in higher out-of-pocket costs. Check your insurance card or contact member services to learn more about preferred pharmacies for your plan.
Fill prescriptions through a mail-order pharmacy.
Many insurance plans offer mail-order pharmacy services at a lower cost. This can be a convenient way to get your medicines, especially for long-term prescriptions or refills.
Find out if a generic medication or preferred brand drug is available.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/understanding-pharmacy-insurance.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:57.086837', 'title': 'Understanding Pharmacy Insurance - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Ways to help lower costs of medicines', 'super_section': None}"
2758,"Find out if a generic medication or preferred brand drug is available.
Brand-name medications:Brand-name drugs are divided into 2 main categories: preferred brands and non-preferred brands. Preferred brand medicines are brand-name drugs that your insurance covers at a lower cost, so they are cheaper for you. Non-preferred brand medicines are also covered but cost more. Picking preferred brands can help you save money on your prescriptions.
Generic drugs:A generic medicine is the same as the brand version in ingredients, safety, strength, quality, and intended use. But they cost less than brand-name drugs.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/understanding-pharmacy-insurance.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:57.086837', 'title': 'Understanding Pharmacy Insurance - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Ways to help lower costs of medicines', 'super_section': None}"
2759,"Your health care provider may specify whether a generic is acceptable. Or they may state that a brand-name medication must be given. “Dispense as Written” (DAW) means that a generic drug cannot take the place of the brand-name drug prescribed by your health care provider.
Check for manufacturer discounts or discount programs.
Many drug manufacturers offer copay assistance cards or coupons for their medications. These are often available on the drug website or through your health care provider. Take the coupon to your pharmacy when you fill your prescription.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/understanding-pharmacy-insurance.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:57.086837', 'title': 'Understanding Pharmacy Insurance - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Ways to help lower costs of medicines', 'super_section': None}"
2760,"Several companies offer free discount cards that can be used at participating pharmacies. These cards can provide discounts and savings on brand-name and generic medications. Show your card to your pharmacy when you fill your prescription.
Check with your pharmacy to see if they have a membership program that offers medication discounts. There may be a small enrollment fee for some programs.
Understand traditional and specialty medicines.
Traditional drugs are standard medicines that are available at most pharmacies.
Specialty medicines are used to treat complex or rare health conditions. They need special handling and prior authorization and are filled through specialty pharmacies. Because of this, they cost more and may not always be covered by your pharmacy plan.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/understanding-pharmacy-insurance.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:57.086837', 'title': 'Understanding Pharmacy Insurance - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Ways to help lower costs of medicines', 'super_section': None}"
2761,"Find out if you are eligible for a Patient Assistance Program (PAP).
Patient assistance programs may be available if you cannot afford your medicines. These programs provide medications or financial aid to help cover prescription costs for people who qualify.
These programs are sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
This may result in medicines provided at little or no cost to the patient.
Medications are often sent directly to the patient’s home or to their health care provider.
Eligibility for a PAP varies but often requires low income, lack of insurance or inadequate coverage, proof of residency, and medical need.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/finances/understanding-pharmacy-insurance.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:57.086837', 'title': 'Understanding Pharmacy Insurance - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Ways to help lower costs of medicines', 'super_section': None}"

2855,"A flu vaccine protects people from developing influenza (flu). Flu is a contagious respiratory (breathing) illness. A flu vaccine causes a person to develop antibodies that recognize and fight flu viruses. This builds up the body’s natural defenses (immunity) against infection.
People need a flu vaccine once a year. This is because the vaccine is different each year. Flu viruses change over time, so the vaccine from last year may not work as well for the next year. Also, your body’s immune response decreases over time.

An annual flu vaccine is one of the best ways to prevent the flu.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/immunity-illness-infection/flu-vaccine.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:59.019872', 'title': 'Flu Vaccines - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is a flu vaccine?', 'super_section': None}"
2856,"A vaccine strengthens the immune system to protect the body from illness. The flu vaccine helps protect people from developing the flu. Some people may still get the flu after being vaccinated. Even if you do get the flu, you may not get as sick. This is because your body is better able to defend itself after getting the vaccine.
Most people who get flu get better in a few days to less than 2 weeks. But some people develop more serious problems or complications. Some problems can be life threatening.
Sinus and ear infections are examples of moderate complications from the flu. Pneumonia is an example of a serious flu complication.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people with certain medical conditions, including:
Asthma
Heart disease
Diabetes","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/immunity-illness-infection/flu-vaccine.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:50:59.019872', 'title': 'Flu Vaccines - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Benefits of the flu vaccine', 'super_section': None}"

Flu shot (needle injection):
There are several different types of flu shots. Most are given in the muscle of the upper arm. Infants and very young children may get the flu shot in the upper thigh.
The flu shot is made with dead (inactivated) flu viruses.
The flu shot is safe for people with weak immune systems.
If your child has a weakened immune system, your child can take it at least 2 weeks before chemotherapy for the best response to the vaccine. Or they can take it between chemotherapy cycles. In the case of a spreading flu illness, your child should get a flu shot as soon as possible with no delay.
Nasal spray (Flumist®):

3243,"A personal medical record (PMR), sometimes called a “personal health record,” is simply a collection of information about your health. Keeping a PMR for a child with cancer is a great idea, as it allows families to bring a comprehensive history of their child’s health to visits with specialists, new doctors, or the emergency room. While there are several apps that help patients keep records of their most important information, it's still best to keep a paper copy of the most important information with you, just in case there's an emergency.
For a child with cancer, your PMR should include:
Name, date of birth, blood type, and emergency contact
Diagnosis
Date of last physical exam
Dates and results of most recent tests and screenings

Be prepared for results: Know when and how you will get results. Stay positive, but make plans for the possibility of bad results. Waiting can make someone feel like they have no control over a situation. Making a plan can give a sense of control.
