In elementary schools, your child’s teacher or principal will often be the representative. In middle school and high school, your child’s guidance counselor will be the representative.
It is helpful to have an introductory meeting that includes parents, teachers from your child’s school, a hospital school program representative, and the child (if able to understand). If your family is far away, you may have a conference call or an online meeting.
Topics to discuss include:
How often your child or teen could miss school
How illness or treatments may affect school performance, thinking skills, ability to pay attention, and emotional well-being
Regular check-in meetings between the family, school, and hospital representatives
The right workload for your child so they can move to the next grade

Embarrassment
Confusion

When you have a child with a serious illness, it is important to try to keep things as normal as possible for their siblings.

20,"Be honest and open with your children. Siblings are often scared because they don’t understand this new experience. Give an age-appropriate description of the illness. Your care team can help you talk about your child’s condition and treatments in ways siblings can understand. If you explain what’s happening, it can lessen fear and confusion.
It is also important to understand what each child thinks about the illness. Children might not know what questions to ask or be afraid to bring it up to parents. Check understanding and then clear up false beliefs or misinformation.
For example, a child may wrongly think that cancer is contagious. Some children may believe that people always die when they have cancer when, in fact, many children can be cured.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/emotional-support-daily-life/for-siblings/parenting-siblings.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:06.432073', 'title': 'Parenting Siblings of a Child with a Serious Illness - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Explain the unknown', 'super_section': None}"

Give children and teens a way to express their anger. For example, encourage your child to draw a picture or write down their feelings in a letter or a journal.Relaxation techniquessuch as deep breathing can also help your child manage emotions.
A child undergoing treatment tends to get gifts and special treats from friends and extended family. This can lead to feelings of jealousy in siblings. Let them know that you understand and look for ways to include siblings and help them feel valued.
Some siblings may imagine that being at the hospital is fun because their brother or sister gets gifts, does not go to school every day, and spends extra time with you. They may only see pictures of your sick child smiling and having fun.

Consider whether you are comfortable with teachers or others at your children’s school talking with siblings about the illness. Let the school know how you prefer they communicate about your child’s illness.

33,"The end of cancer treatment is a joyful time for childhood cancer patients and their families. Friends throw confetti at “off chemo” parties. Patients ring bells or bang gongs after finishing radiation treatments.
However, this time of transition can also be a period of uncertainty and anxiety. It’s normal to feel this way.
The end of cancer treatment is a joyful time, but it is also normal to feel uncertainty and anxiety during the transition.
The hospital has provided a safety net of information and support. Regular lab work, imaging scans, and clinic appointments provide a steady stream of updates about what’s going on with your child medically. Families going through the same situation are everywhere. They can immediately relate to your life.
“You really become close to your medical team and to the other families you see waiting for appointments,” said Shannon, mother of Griffin, 7, who was treated for childhood acute myeloid leukemia. “It’s like a family. You miss those friendships.”
Now Griffin returns to the hospital every few months for check-ups. Shannon is happy her son is finished with chemotherapy. But she misses the regular contact of the close network she was part of while Griffin was in treatment.
On the other hand, it is nice to do normal, everyday tasks like cleaning her own house, she said. A group of friends paid a cleaning service for her house during her son’s treatment, which was wonderful, but she likes returning to a regular routine.

After childhood cancer treatment ends, patients will return to their cancer center on a regular basis for follow-up check-ups, tests, and scans.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/life-after-cancer/transition-off-treatment.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:07.280701', 'title': 'Transition Off Childhood Cancer Treatment - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Transition Off Childhood Cancer Treatment - Together by St. Jude™', 'super_section': None}"
34,"After cancer treatment ends, patients will return to their cancer center on regular basis for follow-up check-ups, tests, and scans. This follow-up period lasts between 2 to 5 years, depending on the pediatric cancer center and the patient’s diagnosis. This phase is sometimes referred to as off therapy.
After this first follow-up period, patients move to long-term follow-up for childhood cancer survivors. The goal of long-term follow-up care is to help cancer survivors stay as healthy as possible and to monitor forlate effects. Late effects are side effects of treatment that appear months or years later. The schedule and details of follow-up visits vary depending on the cancer center and the patient’s needs.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/life-after-cancer/transition-off-treatment.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:07.280701', 'title': 'Transition Off Childhood Cancer Treatment - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Frequent follow-up', 'super_section': None}"

Here are some tips for helping children of different ages.Help your baby (0–12 months)Babies getting treatment might have fewer chances to explore the world around them and reach developmental milestones. After treatment, your baby will likely begin to develop more quickly.Building trust with parents and caregivers is important to a baby’s development. That’s because it helps the baby separate from te from you without getting to upset. After treatment, your baby might separate from you easily at home or in other familiar places but might cling to you during clinic visits or in new places. You can:Offer comfort positions throughout visits.Use the same caregivers when possible.Help your toddler (13–36 months)Many toddlers might act more like babies during treatment. For example, potty training might be slow, separating from parents and caregivers might be a challenge, and temper tantrums might increase. Help your toddler adjust to life at home by being consistent and by setting limits. You can:Give your toddler choices, when possible, to help them learn to be more independent.Allow them to play and express emotions in helpful ways.Help your preschooler (age 3–5)Preschoolers need consistent limits at home. Your preschooler might have had extra attention, toys, or other presents during treatment. If they do not get the same amount of attention after treatment, your preschooler can feel like this is punishment. It may take time for them to adjust to this shift in attention and to being a typical kid. You can:Offer more chances for free play and art activities to help your child express emotions.Answer questions as honestly as possible in words your child can understand.Help your school-age child (age 6–9) or pre-teen (age 10–12)If your child has been out of school during treatment, talk to your health care team about whether your child can benefit from a school re-entry program. A re-entry program can help your child’s teachers and fellow students learn about your child’s diagnosis, treatment, and the effects of illness and treatment. Having well-informed teachers and friends can help your child get back on track at school.School-age children might ask why treatment ended. They may wonder about what will happen now. You can:Be honest with your child. Answer their questions as fully as you can.Give your child’s classmates safe and appropriate ways to spend time with your child.Help your teen or young adult (age 13–19)Challenges for teens and young adults include:Going back to friends, classmates, and coworkersRejoining clubs and teamsMaking college choicesDeveloping careersCancer treatment can affect all these life events. While many teens try to put treatment behind them and not look back, this can actually cause more problems.

42,"Reconnect with your child’s primary care provider. After the end of cancer treatment, this physician becomes your child’s main doctor for routine health care. Talk with the provider and with someone at the child’s pediatric cancer center to find out who to contact when you have questions about your child’s health. It is very common for parents to worry about who to call first – the pediatrician or oncologist.
Set up an appointment with the primary health care provider to talk about the child’s health care needs. Childhood cancer is so rare that pediatricians may work their whole careers without treating a patient with cancer.
Also, ask the provider if your child is due for any immunizations. Sometimes children may have missed certain vaccines during cancer treatment. If so, the Centers for Disease Control has theCatch-Up Immunization Schedule.
Inform other health care providers, such as dentists and optometrists, about your child’s cancer treatments and unique health care needs.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/life-after-cancer/transition-off-treatment.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:07.280701', 'title': 'Transition Off Childhood Cancer Treatment - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Reconnect with your primary health care provider', 'super_section': None}"

59,"When her son Todd finished his treatment forHodgkin lymphoma, his mom, Melissa, was thrilled.
But she remembers being nervous about leaving the cocoon created by her son’scare teamand the other families with whom she had grown so close.
“You always had the comfort of the hospital,” Melissa said. “You knew they were looking after you. After therapy is over, you’re not getting tests. You’re not getting chemotherapy. You worry about every little fever or sickness. That’s scary.”
Melissa was thrilled when her son Todd finished treatment, but remembers being nervous about leaving the cocoon created by the care team and other families.
Fellow mom, Jenny, can relate. She felt a little uneasy when her daughter Mabry reached the end of her treatment forleukemia.
“I don’t think the worry ever totally goes away,” Jenny said. “You learn to cope with it in your own way – whether it’s prayer or talking to someone about it. Look for positive things.”
Patients, parents, and siblings also miss the friends they made with other patients and families.
It’s common to feel anxious at the end of your child’s cancer treatment. Your life has gone through so many changes. Some families describe it as weathering a storm. Families make adjustments to get through the experience. Looking back on it, life has changed. You may find yourself picking up the pieces and finding where they fit — or learning they don’t fit anymore.
When treatment ends, it marks the beginning of something new — rebuilding your life — a life after cancer.
Parents who have been through this transition say it is important for parents to give themselves time to find that “new normal.” It won’t happen right away. Identify people in your life who can help you and reach out to them.

Sleep problems

Parents say it can be hard to know which concern they should share with their primary health care team and which ones require a call to the cancer care team. For example, a fever is an emergency during childhood cancer treatment. But after treatment, it may only warrant a call or visit to the pediatrician.
If you have medical questions, talk to the cancer care team. Care providers can help you determine which matters you should talk to your pediatrician about and which things may be a matter for the cancer care team.

School allows children and teens to be around their peers. Participating in extracurricular activities, sports, and hobbies also provides ways for them to socialize and develop their interests.
But families are encouraged to take the necessary amount of time to make this transition back to school. Sometimes patients don’t feel comfortable going back immediately. Sometimes kids will keep up with school at home (either through homeschooling by parents orhomebound servicesprovided by school) for the rest of the year. They then start back the next school year so they feel emotionally and physically ready.

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, reach out to your care teams — both at home and at the pediatric center where you received treatment.
Every center is different, but you may be able to continue to receive counseling through the pediatric center even after you have finished cancer treatments.
Your care team at home can recommend professionals in your community. It is a good idea to check with your insurance company to make sure the counseling iscovered by insurance. The social work department at your pediatric center can assist you and help locate free or low-cost programs if your insurance does not cover mental health services.

75,"Returning to schoolafter treatment is one of the most important milestones for childhood cancer patients. Many patients can attend school while still in treatment. They are encouraged to return to school as soon as they are medically able.
But the school experience may be different for you after you have been through cancer treatment. You may notice differences in how you learn, think, and process information. These are calledcognitive effects. Before returning to school it may be a good idea to have cognitive screening tests at the hospital to identify any areas of concern.
If you are having challenges, tell your parents and teachers. You and your parents can work with the school to design a learning plan that addresses your learning differences. These may include a504 plan or Individualized Education Program.
Transition back to school gradually. Attending school all day, five days a week may not be possible at first. Many children and teens experience fatigue and weakness and cannot make it through a full day. Others may have immune system concerns and are not able to be in large groups of people. Others may have physical challenges that affect their mobility.
Often children and teens start back on a shortened schedule such as attending half-days or going to school a few days a week until they can return full time.

As parents, you will make mistakes, but the key is to keep trying and moving forward, Missy said.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/life-after-cancer/time-grace-after-therapy.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:09.742744', 'title': 'Time and Grace after Therapy - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Time and Grace after Therapy - Together by St. Jude™', 'super_section': None}"
78,"Each time Todd returned home after the end of treatment, he wanted to jump right back into his previous routines. But his energy and immune system weren’t quite ready.
When Todd returned to school, he had little physical strength. Even walking made him exhausted. In 1st grade, he needed a nap every day after lunch. There were several trips to the doctor. His strength needed to rebuild. His parents’ natural tendency as parents was to protect their son.
“He would get upset with us. We were leery of him doing a lot of things. He thought we were overprotective,” Missy said.
Later they decided to give Todd freedom to make decisions. “Our approach was not to tell him no, but to allow him to see for himself,” Missy said. “Try it out and see.”
In ninth grade, Todd wanted to try out for the football team. After a while, he realized he couldn’t keep up physically. He made the decision not to continue.
But Todd loved sports and wanted to stay active. His parents put up a basketball goal at home so he could play when he felt like it. Now he plays basketball in gym everyday.
When Todd started playing percussion in the school band, the band director made adjustments to allow for Todd’s fatigue. During his freshman year, Todd stayed in one place when the band performed on the football field.
Later he played the marimba and the drums and moved from instrument to instrument.
He now marches in parades. But it took him a good year to get to that point.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/life-after-cancer/time-grace-after-therapy.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:09.742744', 'title': 'Time and Grace after Therapy - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Take It Slow After Cancer Therapy Ends', 'super_section': None}"
79,"Time away fromschooland the long-term fatigue Todd experienced made it challenging to keep up with school.
Because Todd took naps every day after lunch in first grade, he missed reading and language arts portion of the day. The family hired a tutor who worked with Todd twice a week to help him.
In fourth grade, he missed about 60 days of school during the second semester. He was absent during lessons on division and equations.
Teachers sent packets for him to work on. The family also hired a tutor to help Todd with math, particularly division.
In seventh grade, he missed more than 60 days of school. Todd had a line infection and an allergic reaction to chemo. He was in the intensive care unit (ICU) for a week.
When Todd entered the eighth grade, the family decided to select a less demanding academic schedule to allow him to catch up. Todd took advanced classes instead of continuing on with the gifted curriculum.
Now in 10th grade, he is taking some dual enrollment course that allow him to earn college credits.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/life-after-cancer/time-grace-after-therapy.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:09.742744', 'title': 'Time and Grace after Therapy - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Academic Challenges', 'super_section': None}"
80,"Managing family life was a challenge to say the least, Missy said.
During Todd’s first round of cancer treatment, he got chemotherapy every Friday for eight weeks. His father, Chris, worked offshore in the Gulf of Mexico for two weeks at a time, with two weeks off in between. Todd’s older brother, Daniel, could travel to the hospital with Missy and Todd because treatments were during the summer.
During his second diagnosis, Todd received three months of chemotherapy followed by three and a half weeks of radiation therapy. Todd and Missy left home on a Sunday so Todd could get chemo on Monday and go home to Louisiana on Tuesday or Wednesday.
During this time, Chris was working in Mozambique. Missy’s father, Stan, moved into the family home to keep things as normal as possible for Daniel, who was then in eighth grade. Todd’s radiation treatments happened during the summer, so Daniel traveled to the hospital with his mother and brother.
During his third treatment, Todd spent a long period of time in the hospital because he had a transplant. Missy’s father moved back in to the family home. At this time, Daniel was a junior in high school.
With so much upheaval, Missy remembers feeling guilty about leaving Daniel behind.
“He could be in his environment in his house and his toys and his gaming. He understood why we had to go, but we were still leaving him,” Missy said. “He was concerned about his brother. Mom wasn’t here. Dad wasn’t here. For me as a parent, I felt guilty. I missed milestones. I missed his spring concert, award days at school. You do feel guilty. I knew there was nothing I could do about it. I talked to him before and said how proud I was of him. I would tell him to call afterward to tell me all about it.”","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/life-after-cancer/time-grace-after-therapy.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:09.742744', 'title': 'Time and Grace after Therapy - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Caring for Siblings', 'super_section': None}"
81,"Missy found that some habits and routines that were OK while Todd was having treatment had to end once the family was back at home.
“We were told in the beginning not to treat Todd like he was sick – treat him like a normal kid,” Missy said. “If you wouldn’t allow them to get away with something before, don’t let them get away with it now. We did better than some people, but we didn’t do our best.”
Food was the hardest. When Todd was sick and didn’t want to eat, Missy was happy when he would eat anything. They ate Mexican food five times a week.
“When they’re sick you want them to eat. After we were home, he felt entitled to pick whatever he wanted to eat. He thought he called the shots,” Missy said.
Todd had to adjust to not being the sick kid anymore. Missy needed to focus more attention on Daniel. She wanted to reconnect to the community again. Missy and her husband needed time together as a couple.
Through the help of family, friends, and counseling, the family was able to rebuild their lives, Missy said.
“You have to find a balance. It’s hard to get it right, but eventually things get back to normal.”","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/life-after-cancer/time-grace-after-therapy.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:09.742744', 'title': 'Time and Grace after Therapy - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Parenting Challenges After Therapy', 'super_section': None}"

86,"In general, there are two main types of advance directives:

Medical powers of attorney and designation of health care agents, which allow you to select someone else to make decisions for you.
Specifics might vary by state and country law.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/medical-care/navigating-health-care/health-care-decision-making.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:10.480967', 'title': 'How to Plan Health Care Decision Making - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Types of advance directives', 'super_section': None}"
87,"Living wills and advance care plans allow you to say what kinds of care you would or would not want. They can help if you cannot make your wishes known.
This plan may also be called a health care directive or health care declaration.
A living will often refers to life-sustaining measures. This means advanced, high-tech care that can keep you alive past the time when you might normally die.
These measures may include:
CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) – Urgent treatment to restart your heart and breathing after they have stopped
Ventilator – A machine that breathes for you
Dialysis – A machine that does the work of your kidneys
Tube or IV feeding – If you are no longer able to swallow

122,"Honesty and openness with your child will build trust and strengthen your relationship. It might be tempting to avoid telling your child that they have cancer. It is natural to want to protect children from anything difficult.
But children are observant. Even if it looks like they are not paying attention, they watch their parents, care team members, and other family members or adults to figure out what is going on. It is likely that during some point your child will hear the wordcancerfrom staff, another hospital peer, or even family and friends. Your child will likely hear the word even if you warn people not to use it.
Many parents report that explaining cancer instead of trying to prevent people from talking about it takes less energy. And it can remove the strain of always trying to maintain defense.
It is important to keep the lines of communication open. Even young children can sense when something is wrong. If you do not tell your child what is going on, they will likely make assumptions or use their imagination. Often what they imagine can be worse than the truth.
Children tend to blame themselves when something difficult happens to them. They need to know cancer is not their fault.
The more your child understands, the less scary things are. Children tend to be cooperative with treatment if they know that it may help them.

125,"Most children and teens have the same basic questions:
What is cancer?
Why did I get it?
Will I get better?
What’s going to happen?
When can we go home?
What about school?
Children need information to manage treatments or procedures, cope with feelings, and have some control over their situation. Most of all, they need to know they are loved, supported, and surrounded by people who care about them.
Trust your instincts. You know your child better than anyone else. You know the best way to tell them. Here are some helpful tips.
Give age-appropriate information. Consider talking with achild life specialistat the cancer center. They are experts in child development. They can help you explain cancer using age-appropriate terms based on the child’s developmental stage. They can explain concepts using therapeutic medical play and visual aids.Social workers,psychologists, andchaplainscan also provide support.
Consider how much information to share at one time. It is usually wise to start with general information. Try not to overload your child with too many details at once. Have several short conversations. A child may have trouble processing too many details. You can share more information over time.
Watch your child for cues. If they change the subject or start looking for distraction, they probably have enough information at that time.
Allow their questions to lead the conversation. Feeling safe to ask questions is a great way for them to communicate they want more information and for you to learn which details they want.
Help your child understand basic facts about the illness, the treatment, and what to expect.
Explain common terms the child will hear often, such as cancer, tumor, chemotherapy, and side effects.
Encourage your child to share feelings and ask questions. Answer your child’s questions and have honest, ongoing conversations. This will help your child cope.
Know that children are sometimes afraid to ask questions. Watch their reactions to different situations. For example, if children seem upset when they see a child without hair, use that as a chance to ask them about their feelings or if they have any questions.
Affirm truths and correct misinformation. Your child may have already formed ideas about cancer based on TV programs or on information heard from family or friends before their own diagnosis. Ask your child what they already know about cancer.
Offer hope. The care team is there to help them face cancer. Many treatments are available to help make the cancer go away.
Don’t forget siblings. Remember that brothers and sisters need explanations, too.
Children need information so they can process and cope with the situation. They also need to know they are supported and loved.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/emotional-support-daily-life/parents/talking-to-your-child-about-cancer.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:12.395487', 'title': 'How to Talk to Your Child about Cancer - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'How to explain cancer to a child', 'super_section': None}"

Misconception — Everyone dies from cancer. You can explain that cancer is a serious illness, but millions of people survive it.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the blood andbone marrow. It is the most common form of childhood cancer.
In leukemia, cancer cells grow rapidly in the bone marrow. When this happens, healthy blood cells — white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets — cannot do their jobs correctly.
ALL affects white blood cells calledlymphocytes. These cells fight infection and help protect the body against disease.
There are 2 types of lymphocytes:B lymphocytesandT lymphocytes. ALL may arise from either type of lymphocyte. Cases of ALL are known as either B cell or T cell ALL. B cell ALL is more common.
About 3,000 children and teens are found to have ALL each year in the United States.
ALL occurs most often in children ages 2–5. It is also found in older children and teens.

Risk group refers to the chance that the cancer will not respond to treatment (refractory) or will return (relapse). There are treatment options forrelapsed or refractory ALL.
Risk groups include low, standard, high, and very high.
The method of chemotherapy and types of medicine depend on the child’s risk group. For example, children and teens with high-risk leukemia receive more anticancer drugs and/or higher doses than children with low risk ALL.
Risk groups are determined by:
Whether the cancer began in B-lymphocytes or T-lymphocytes:B-cell ALL is considered lower-risk than T-cell ALL.
Age:Children ages 1–9 with B-cell ALL are generally considered low-or standard-risk.Children younger than 1and children 10 or older are considered high-risk patients. (This age cut-off may vary among treatment centers.)
White blood cell count at diagnosis:Children with a count below 50,000 are considered low-risk.

Adrenocortical cancer
Cancer of the adrenal cortex
Adrenocortical adenoma
Adrenocortical carcinoma
The body has 2 adrenal glands, 1 on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. These hormones have important jobs such as:
Controlling how the body uses carbs, fats, and proteins for energy
Helping the body cope with stress
Controlling blood pressure
Regulating water, potassium, and salt in the body
The outer layer of the adrenal gland is called the adrenal cortex. The adrenal cortex produces male and female sex hormones calledandrogensandestrogens. These hormones affect the development of male and female traits.
Adrenocortical tumor is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland. The adrenal glands produce hormones that control important body functions.
ACT treatment usually includessurgeryto remove the tumor and adrenal gland. There is a good chance of cure if the tumor is fully removed by surgery.

Endocrine function monitoring
It is important to monitor endocrine function in patients with ACT. Children with functioning tumors need medicines to treat symptoms of excess hormones. Children with low adrenal gland function need hormones to help regulate the body’s functions, including the stress response.
Genetic testing and counseling
Children with ACT should be tested for the TP53 gene. People with agermline mutationin this gene have a condition calledLi-Fraumeni syndrome. Family members of patients with this mutation should also be tested.
TheTP53gene is found in cells throughout the body. It tells cells to make a protein that keeps bad or damaged cells from dividing.
A change inTP53raises the risk for certain cancers. People with a mutation in this gene should avoid exposure to radiation. Lifelong monitoring is important because of high cancer risk.

234,"The chance of cure depends on the type of tumor and its location. Some low-grade astrocytomas have a survival rate of 95% or higher in the United States. But certain high-grade astrocytomas have a survival rate of 10–30%. Clinical trials may be an option.
Factors that influence chance of cure include:
Type and grade of the tumor:Low-grade astrocytomas grow more slowly. They are less likely to come back. High-grade astrocytomas can be harder to treat and often come back.
Location of the tumor:Tumors in the cerebrum or cerebellum have a greater chance of cure. Tumors in the middle of the brain or brainstem have a lower chance because they are hard to remove with surgery.
If surgery can completely remove the tumor:Children who have no visible tumor after surgery have the best chance of cure.
Age at diagnosis:Children with low-grade astrocytoma who are older than age 3 at diagnosis tend to have a better outcome compared to younger children. In high-grade astrocytoma, patients diagnosed at a young age tend to do better.
Whether the cancer has spread:Cancer that has spread to other parts of the brain or spine is harder to treat.
Whether the child has NF1:Patients with low-grade astrocytoma who have neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tend to do better than patients who do not have NF1.
If the cancer is new or if it has come back:Disease that has come back (recurrent) is harder to treat.
Molecular features of the tumor:Certain changes in genes and cell features of the tumor can make the disease easier to treat.

244,"AT/RT is a type ofrhabdoid tumor. Malignant rhabdoid tumors have a common abnormal gene. More than 95% of AT/RTs are related to a change in theSMARCB1gene (also known asINI1,SNF5, andBAF47gene). About 1–2% of the time, malignant rhabdoid tumor is caused by a mutation in theSMARCA4gene.
In most cases, the gene mutation occurs only in the tumor cells. But about 25–30% of children with AT/RT have the gene change in every cell of their body. These children have rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome (RTPS). This mutation can be passed down from a parent. It could also be a new mutation that happens by chance.
Genetic testing and counseling are important for family members and patients with rhabdoid tumors. RTPS can increase the risk of benign tumors calledschwannomasand rhabdoid tumors at a different site. Whether RTPS increases the risk of developing other cancers in later life is an area of research.

Choroid plexus papilloma:Generally, CPP has a very good prognosis. The survival rate is almost 100% if the tumor can be completely removed with surgery.
Atypical choroid plexus papilloma:Prognosis for atypical CPP depends on how much tumor could be removed and how the disease responds to treatments.
Choroid plexus carcinoma:CPC is more aggressive and grows and spreads more quickly. The chance of survival ranges from 50–70%, depending on factors like how much tumor could be removed and whether the cancer has spread.
Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes for patients with choroid plexus tumors. Factors that influence prognosis include:
Age of the child. Children under age 4 have a poorer prognosis.
If cancer spreads to other areas of the brain and spinal cord
How much of the tumor remains after surgery. Complete removal improves the chances of survival.

CML is achronicleukemia. It develops slowly over time. It may take weeks or months for symptoms to appear. Chronic also means that the leukemia may last a long time.Acuteleukemias make children ill quickly.
CML is rare in children. Only 110–120 cases are seen each year in the United States and Canada.
About 90–95% of children with CML have a genetic change called thePhiladelphia chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome is not passed from parent to child. It occurs randomly.

312,"Treatment depends on the phase of cancer.
First-line treatment for CML is usually the drugimatinib(Gleevec®). This drug is a type oftargeted therapyknown as tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Tyrosine kinase is a property of certain enzymes made by the body. The tyrosine kinase activity can become too high in cancer, causing cancer cells to grow. Imatinib blocks the tyrosine kinase activity and helps stop the growth of cancer cells.
Other TKI drugs calleddasatinib,nilotinib, and ponatinib are sometimes used if patients cannot tolerate imatinib. These drugs are sometimes called 2nd generation TKIs.
During treatment, doctors closely watch how patients respond to therapy. This is calledmonitoring. Monitoring may include a health history, physical exam,complete blood count, and molecular testing.
Molecular testing can measure the number of leukemia cells in blood. It can find 1 leukemia cell among 10,000–100,000 normal cells. Molecular tests occur every 3–6 months after the start of therapy.
Testing can also show changes in CML cells. After taking a TKI drug, CML cells may change. The change may mean the medicine will not work as well. Doctors use this information to guide treatment.
Children may face side effects not seen in adults, such as growth problems. This is because children are growing during treatment with TKI drugs. Talk to your child’s care team about possible side effects.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/chronic-myeloid-leukemia-cml.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:15.719396', 'title': 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in Children and Teens - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia', 'super_section': None}"

A differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is a type ofthyroid cancer. The thyroid gland is just below the throat in the front of the neck. It makes hormones that control body functions.
DTCs are the most common type of thyroid cancer in children.
There are 2 types of DTCs:
Papillary thyroid cancer:Often appears as small lumps (called nodules) in the thyroid gland. These lumps are made up of abnormal cells and can grow in 1 or both parts (lobes) of the thyroid. By the time doctors find this cancer, it has often spread to nearby lymph nodes in the neck.

Follicular thyroid cancer:Starts in the thyroid gland’s follicular cells. These cells make hormones to control metabolism. Follicular thyroid cancer usually stays in the neck area. But it can sometimes spread to the lungs and bones.
Follicular thyroid cancer:Starts in the thyroid gland’s follicular cells. These cells make hormones to control metabolism. Follicular thyroid cancer usually stays in the neck area. But it can sometimes spread to the lungs and bones.
About 90% (9 of 10) of thyroid cancer cases in children are papillary thyroid cancer.
The thyroid gland uses iodine from your food to make hormones. Iodine is a mineral that your body needs to stay healthy. Your thyroid gland uses iodine to make hormones that control your metabolism, energy levels, and growth. Differentiated thyroid cancers absorb iodine. This is important for screening and treatment with radioactive iodine.
Surgeryto remove the cancer is the main treatment. Patients with intermediate and high-risk DTC may receive treatment with a special form of iodine called I-131 radioactive iodine. This type of iodine gives off a small amount of energy. The treatment helps target and destroy any remaining thyroid cells.

Hypothyroidism may be temporary or permanent.Nerve or vocal cord problemsAnother risk of thyroid surgery is nerve damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This nerve helps the vocal cords move for speech. Nerve problems after thyroid removal are rare.A specialist will do a ""scope"" procedure to check the vocal cords before and after surgery.

Some intermediate-risk and all high-risk patients receive TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin and a diagnostic whole-body scan. This scan looks for the spread of thyroid cancer to other parts of the body.
For this test:
The care team gives the patient a radioactive tracer, usually radioiodine I-123. This level of radiation is quite low.
Thyroid cells normally use iodine to make hormones. Thyroid cancer cells do the same, so they take up the tracer.
The radiologist takes pictures using a special camera that can see the tracer. The pictures show the location of cancer in the body.
Based on the results and thyroglobulin levels, the doctor may treat the patient with radioactive iodine to kill the cancer cells. The patient may have more surgery to remove the cancer.
Radioactive iodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancerPatients with intermediate and high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer may receive I-131 radioactive iodine treatment.In this therapy, the care team uses a special form of iodine that gives off a small amount of radiation. Thyroid cells and thyroid cancer cells absorb the iodine, which allows the radiation to work inside the body to destroy the cancer cells. This also helps treat cancer that may have spread to other areas.Doctors carefully plan this treatment to keep the rest of the body safe. The radiation mainly targets thyroid cells and does not stay in the body for long. Patients may need to follow safety steps for a short time, like avoiding close contact with others, until most of the radiation has left their body.Some studies have suggested that this treatment may slightly increase the risk of second cancers. But researchers are still studying these effects, especially in children and teens. The medical team and family must weigh the risks and benefits to choose the best treatment plan.Low iodine dietYour child must stay on a low-iodine diet for 7 days before receiving I-123 or I-131.

367,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG, is an aggressive brain tumor. It forms in the base of the brain. DIPG begins in thebrain stem. The area is called the pons.
The pons controls vital life functions including:
Breathing
Heart rate
Blood pressure
Nerves that control vision, hearing, speech, swallowing, balance, and movement also pass through this part of the brain.
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive brain tumor. It begins in the brainstem in an area called the pons. The pons controls vital life functions as well as the nerves that control vision, hearing, speech, swallowing, and movement.
About 200–300 new cases of DIPG are diagnosed every year in the United States. DIPG most often occurs in children ages 5–10 years old. But it can occur in younger children and teens. DIPG is rare in adults.
DIPG is a type of high-grade glioma. It grows from glial cells that make up the supportive tissue of the brain. DIPG is a diffuse tumor. This means it is not well-defined or contained. The tumor extends finger-like projections into healthy tissue.
Because of the location and spread-out growth of the tumor, surgery cannot safely remove DIPG.
DIPG is very hard to treat and there is no cure. Most children do not survive more than 2 years after diagnosis. The main treatment for DIPG isradiation therapy. Radiation temporarily improves symptoms in most patients, but it is not a cure. Families may considerclinical trialsthat test new treatments to see if outcomes can be improved.
Earlypalliative careis important. It can help families manage symptoms and promote quality of life.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma-dipg.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:16.615001', 'title': 'Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) in Children - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is DIPG?', 'super_section': None}"
368,"DIPG tumors grow quickly. Symptoms usually develop in a short period of time (often about 1 month before diagnosis). There is a rapid onset and fastprogression.
Signs and symptoms of DIPG may include:
Loss of balance or problems walking
Eye problems such as blurred vision, double vision, drooping eyelids, uncontrolled eye movements, not being able to fully close the eye, eyes don’t look the same direction together or appear crossed (strabismus)
Facial weakness or drooping, usually on 1 side
Drooling or problems swallowing
Weakness in the legs and arms, usually on 1 side
Irregular or jerking movements
Abnormal reflexes
In very young children, a failure to thrive
Less common symptoms may include:
Nausea and vomiting
Headache, especially in the morning and often better after vomiting
Behavioral changes, school problems, irritability, or night laughter

370,"An MRI can be used to diagnose diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
A physical exam and medical history help doctors learn about symptoms, general health, past illness, and risk factors.
Aneurological exammeasures different aspects of brain function. These include memory, vision, hearing, muscle strength, balance, coordination, and reflexes.
Imaging testshelp identify the tumor, see how big the tumor is, and find out what brain areas may be affected.Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is the main imaging test used to diagnose DIPG.
Doctors look for key features of the tumor on the MRI to diagnose DIPG:
The tumor is in the pons.
It usually involves and expands most of the pons (intrinsic).
The tumor does not have well-defined borders. It moves into healthy tissue (diffuse).
About 10–20% of pediatric brain tumors are found in the brain stem. A tumor in the brain stem is usually DIPG. But about 20% (2 out of 10) of brain stem tumors arelow-grade astrocytomas.

371,"Doctors sometimes use abiopsyto diagnose DIPG. In the past, a biopsy was not usually done. Reasons for not doing a biopsy include:
DIPG often has specific features on MRI and clinical evaluation. This means it can be diagnosed without any more tests.
There is risk of harm from a biopsy. This is because of the tumor’s location.
A biopsy may not change treatment plans or outcomes.
Because of advances in surgery and treatments, biopsy has become more common for DIPG. After a biopsy, a pathologist looks at the tissue sample under a microscope to identify the type and grade of tumor. The tumor is tested for genetic changes or markers. Understanding molecular features may one day offer better treatments for DIPG. These could include targeted therapy and immunotherapy.
Diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant:About 80% (8 out of 10) of DIPG tumors have a specific mutation, or change in the DNA. This mutation is known as H3 K27M. These tumors most often occur in the pons. But they may also be found in the thalamus, spinal cord, or other sites in the midline of the brain. Even without a biopsy, it is thought that most DIPG tumors have the H3 K27M mutation. Tumors with an H3 K27M mutation usually have a poor outcome no matter the grade or how they appear under the microscope.
No one knows the cause of DIPG. But scientists are learning more about gene changes linked to these tumors. Having certain genetic disorders, including neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), may increase the risk of a brain stem glioma.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma-dipg.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:16.615001', 'title': 'Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) in Children - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Role of biopsy in DIPG diagnosis', 'super_section': None}"

Whether DIPG is found only in the brain stem or if it has spread to distant areas in the brain or spinal cord (metastatic disease)
Whether DIPG is newly diagnosed or has come back after treatment (recurrent disease)
Gliomas are grouped by how they look under the microscope. The more abnormal the cells look, the higher the grade. Grade 1 and 2 tumors are low-grade gliomas. The cells look more like normal cells and grow more slowly.
Grade 3 and 4 tumors are high-grade gliomas. They are aggressive and grow quickly. These tumors can spread throughout the brain.

A number ofclinical trialsare exploring therapies that may improve outcomes for patients with DIPG.
Radiation therapy for DIPGRadiation therapyis the main treatment for DIPG. In most cases, radiation provides a temporary response to slow or shrink the tumor. But radiation therapy does not provide a long-term cure. It may ease symptoms for an average of 6 months. It may extend life by an average of 3 months.At most U.S. treatment centers, the standard guideline is local radiation therapy for 6–7 weeks.Newer studies suggest thathypofractionated radiation therapymay offer similar benefits with less burden on the patient and family. This approach gives larger doses of radiation over a shorter time (usually 3 weeks).Radiation usually helps stall disease progression for a time. Recent studies have shown that repeat radiation to the DIPG tumor can be done safely. But when the disease comes back, the tumor is more resistant to radiation, and the benefits are more limited.

Many patients with DIPG get care through a clinical trial. Clinical trials are available:
At the time of diagnosis
After completion of radiation therapy but before the disease progresses
After tumor progression
Many times, the tumor may shrink for a while after initial radiation therapy. Symptoms improve, and patients can go home to their usual activities. This is sometimes called the “honeymoon period.”

382,"Weight gain, face swelling, and puffiness are mainly due to high doses of corticosteroid medicines given to help manage symptoms of DIPG. These symptoms are not usually due to the tumor itself.
Brain tumors can cause fluid and pressure to build up in the brain (hydrocephalus). This pressure causes symptoms such as headaches, nausea, weakness, and problems walking. Steroid medicines likedexamethasonedecrease brain swelling and pressure. But they also have side effects, especially when given in high doses or for a long time.
Corticosteroids can increase appetite and cause patients to eat more and gain weight. These medicines can make it hard for the body to get rid of fluids, causing swelling. The body may also store fat differently. This can lead to puffy cheeks or “moon face.”
Rapid weight gain sometimes causes stretch marks on the skin. The change in appearance due to corticosteroids can be distressing to patients and families. Other side effects of steroid treatment include mood swings, irritability, and muscle weakness.
Despite the side effects, these medicines are an important part of supportive care and quality of life for many brain tumor patients. Talk to your care team aboutside effectsand goals of care.

402,"Ependymoma is a tumor of the brain and spinal cord. About 200 children are diagnosed with ependymoma in the United States each year.
Ependymomas are most common in children under age 5. But these tumors may happen at any age. Rarely, they can spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This fluid surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.
Ependymomas grow from cells that line the fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord.
In children, about 75% of ependymomas are in theposterior fossaregion of the brain. This space near the base of the skull contains the cerebellum and brain stem. But ependymomas can also form in other areas of thecentral nervous system(CNS).
The parts of the CNS that are affected depend on the tumor’s location. These include the:
Cerebrum
Cerebellum
Brainstem
Spinal cord
Many ependymomas form in the 4th ventriclein the posterior fossa. These tumors are most likely to affect the brain stem and cerebellum.
Treatment for ependymoma includes:
Surgeryto remove as much of the tumor as possible
Radiation therapyto kill any remaining cancer cells
Chemotherapyis sometimes used before a second surgery. Chemotherapy is not typically used if the entire tumor has been removed.
The survival rate for childhood ependymoma is 50–70% (5–7 of 10).Prognosisdepends on:
The location of the tumor
The amount of tumor that can be removed with surgery
Molecular features (the underlying biology) of the tumor
Doctors are learning more about the biology and molecular features of ependymoma. These details can help predict how a tumor might respond to treatment. Ependymoma has many molecular subtypes with different clinical features.
Ependymoma can come back after treatment. Children often need long-term care to watch for this.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/ependymoma.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:17.102882', 'title': 'Ependymoma in Children and Teens - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is ependymoma?', 'super_section': None}"

Back or neck pain
Vision problems
Loss of balance or problems walking
Leg weakness
Seizures
Irritability or confusion
Problems urinating (peeing)
Change in bowel function
Increased head size in infants
As the tumor grows, it may block the normal flow of CSF. This causes a fluid buildup in the brain known ashydrocephalus. The fluid increases pressure in the brain. Many symptoms of ependymoma are due to hydrocephalus.
Sometimes an ependymoma can block the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Hydrocephalus occurs when too much CSF builds up in the ventricles.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/ependymoma.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:17.102882', 'title': 'Ependymoma in Children and Teens - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Symptoms of ependymoma', 'super_section': None}"

Certain changes in genes and chromosomes in the tumor cells are linked to ependymoma. These are not usually passed down from parents. In most cases, it is not known why these genetic changes occur.

438,"Ganglioglioma is a rare brain tumor that usually begins in the temporal lobe but it can also occur in other parts of the brain and spinal cord.
A ganglioglioma is a rare brain tumor that grows from nerve cells (neurons) and supportive cells (glial cells). Gangliogliomas usually develop in the temporal lobe, a brain area located behind the ears. This area is important for memory, understanding language, and processing emotions. But gangliogliomas can also occur in other parts of the brain and spinal cord and affect a variety of brain functions.
Most gangliogliomas occur in children and young adults. About 95% of gangliogliomas arelow-grade gliomas. These tumors generally grow slowly and are noncancerous, meaning they do not spread to other parts of the body. But a small number of gangliogliomas (5–10%) are malignant (cancerous), high-grade tumors.
Treatment usually involvessurgeryto remove as much of the tumor as possible. If the whole tumor cannot be removed or if it starts to grow again, doctors may use treatments likeradiation,chemotherapy, ortargeted therapy.
Most people with ganglioglioma do well after treatment, especially if the tumor is found early.

467,"Germ cell tumors in the brain and spinal cord are rare tumors that often occur near the pineal gland or near the pituitary gland in the brain.
Most germ cell brain tumors develop in early adolescence, but the cause is not fully known.
Germ cell brain tumors can be classified as germinomas (which are more common and often respond well to treatment) or non-germinomas (which can be harder to treat and need more intensive therapy).
Treatment of germ cell brain tumors usually includes a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and sometimes surgery.
Each case of germ cell tumor is different. Your child’s health care provider is your best source of information.

469,"Germ cell tumors are formed bygerm cells, a type of reproductive cell. They are the cells that become eggs in females or sperm in males. Germ cells develop as a baby grows inside the mother. Sometimes, germ cells can form tumors, called germ cell tumors. Germ cell tumors may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).
Germ cell tumors can occur in the:
Ovary or testicle (gonadal germ cell tumor)
Neck
Chest area between the lungs (mediastinal)
Back part of the abdomen (retroperitoneal)
Lower part of the spine or tailbone (sacrum, coccyx)
Brain (seeIntracranial Germ Cell Tumors)
Extracranial germ cell tumorsare germ cell tumors that form outside of the brain. They are often found in reproductive organs (ovaries or testicles). These are calledgonadal germ cell tumors.
Germ cell tumors that form outside of the ovaries and testicles are calledextragonadal germ cell tumors. These tumors usually grow along the center of the body.
Germ cell tumors can develop at any age. In pediatric patients, they occur most often in young children and in teens. They account for about 3% of childhood cancers.
Surgery is the main treatment for germ cell tumor. In some cases, germ cell tumor can be treated withsurgeryalone.Chemotherapymay be used with surgery.

567,"Physicians base treatment decisions on the risk of the disease coming back (relapse). Patients with a higher risk of relapse will receive more intensive treatment than those with lower risk.
Most infants have a change in a gene (rearrangement) called MLL (mixed lineage leukemia). Another name for MLL is KMT2A.
When treating infant ALL, physicians consider:
Gene changes:Having an MLL rearrangement predicts a poorer response to therapy.
Age: Infants closer to age 1 usually respond better to treatment than infants younger than 6 months.
Number of white blood cells: A very high white blood cell count when your child is first diagnosed predicts a poorer response to therapy.
Timing of response to early therapy: Children who show a positive response to initial treatment have a lower risk of relapse.
The survival rate for infants with ALL is less than 60%. Infants with theMLL(KMT2A) rearrangement have a high risk of relapse. Most relapses occur within a year of diagnosis.
New insights into the disease show promise in developing new treatments. These include adding immunotherapy and targeted therapy to standard chemotherapy used to treat ALL in infants. Promising new therapies include:
Blinatumomab
Vorinostat
Azacytidine
Venetoclax
Menin inhibitors","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/infant-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-all.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:20.062303', 'title': 'Infant Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Prognosis of infant ALL', 'super_section': None}"

JMML occurs most often in children younger than age 4. About 10% of cases are in infants younger than 3 months.
Each year 1–2 children out of 1 million are diagnosed with JMML in the United States. That is 25–50 a year.
JMML occurs when bone marrow makes too many white blood cells called monocytes and myelocytes. The cells build up in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and blood. When this happens, the blood does not work as it should. The body cannot fight infection as well.
JMML can be aggressive.Stem cell transplantis the only treatment that can cure JMML. But in 15% of cases, JMML will go away on its own without treatment.

617,"Leukemia is a cancer of thebloodandbone marrow. It is the most common cancer in children and teens. About 3,500–4,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the US.
In leukemia, bone marrow does not work correctly. Bone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue in the center of most bones. It works like a blood cell factory. All blood cells start here. They begin as blood-forming stem cells.
In time, these stem cells turn into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
In a patient with leukemia, stem cells do not mature correctly. The blood produces too many immature blood cells or leukemia cells.
When this happens, the blood cannot do its job well. It does not have enough:
Red blood cellsto carry oxygen to the body’s organs
White blood cellsto fight infection and disease
Plateletsto make the blood clot
Leukemias are either acute or chronic. Acute means the symptoms develop quickly without treatment. Chronic means that the disease and symptoms develop slowly.
Acute leukemias are more common in children.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

Theliveris a large organ on the top right side of the abdomen. The liver:
Helps clear waste from the blood
Makes bile to help digest food
Stores energy to fuel the body
Liver cancer occurs when cancer cells form tumors in the tissue of the liver.
Surgeryis the main treatment option for liver cancers. The goal of surgery is to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Patients have a good chance for cure if the tumor can be completely removed.
Chemotherapymay be used to shrink the tumor before surgery. It can also help stop or slow the growth of cancer cells after surgery.

Low-grade gliomas are the most commoncentral nervous system(CNS) tumors in children.
Low-grade glioma (LGG) tumors grow slowly. These tumors can happen anywhere in the brain or spinal cord. They are most common in the cerebellum, located at the back of the brain.
Pediatric low-grade gliomas rarely spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord. They can often be cured if they can be removed. But the tumors may happen in areas of the brain where surgery is not recommended. In these cases, patients may be treated with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation.

688,"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), also known asmedullary thyroid carcinoma, is a type ofthyroid cancer.
The thyroid gland is located just below the throat in the front of the neck. The thyroid makes hormones that control body functions. MTC starts in parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland. These cells make a hormone called calcitonin.
Medullary thyroid cancer is rare in children. Most often, childhood MTC is linked to an inherited change in the RET gene. This causes a condition called familial MTC ormultiple endocrine neoplasia type 2(MEN2 syndromes).
Surgery to remove the thyroid gland is the main treatment for medullary thyroid cancer. For children with a genetic predisposition, doctors may remove the thyroid before the cancer develops.
Patients need ongoing care from a team of specialists to manage hormones and watch for the return of cancer.
The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located at the base of the throat in the front of the neck. It is arranged in two lobes, one on the right side and one on the left side.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/medullary-thyroid-cancer.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:23.382665', 'title': 'Medullary Thyroid Cancer in Children and Teens - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is medullary thyroid cancer?', 'super_section': None}"

SurgeryThe main treatment for medullary thyroid cancer is surgery to remove the thyroid gland. This is called a total thyroidectomy. The surgeon may also remove nearby lymph nodes and other tissues, known as neck dissection. These surgeries help stop the cancer from coming back.An experienced surgeon should perform the surgery. Look for one who does this type of surgery regularly in pediatric patients. This lowers the risk of problems afterward.The thyroid makes hormones that control some body functions. After thyroid removal, the body will not make these hormones. To replace the missing hormone, your child will need to take thyroid hormone replacement medication (levothyroxine) for the rest of their life.Physical therapycan help your child with neck strength and movement after surgery.Preventive surgery for MEN syndromesThe best way to treat MTC is to prevent the spread of the disease. Children with genetic mutations are at higher risk for developing this cancer. Doctors may do surgery to remove the thyroid gland before cancer is found (prophylactic thyroidectomy).Doctors recommend this surgery for children younger than 5 years who have a MEN2A mutation. A child with a MEN2B mutation should have a thyroidectomy before age 1. In patients with the MEN2B mutation, MTC develops early and is aggressive.Risks of thyroid surgeryThere is a risk of damage to neck structures during surgery, such as the nerves and parathyroid glands.Hypoparathyroidism due to damage to parathyroid glandsParathyroid glands are small and lie behind the thyroid. They keep calcium at normal levels in the body. Sometimes, parathyroid glands are harmed during surgery. The parathyroid glands may become ""stunned"" after this surgery, even if they are not damaged.Patients may get a condition known as transient post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. Symptoms of this condition include:Low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia)Numbness and tingling in the hands, feet, and faceMuscle crampsDoctors treat this condition with vitamin D (calcitriol) and calcium supplements until these problems stop. Hypoparathyroidism may be brief or permanent.Nerve or vocal cord problemsAnother risk of thyroid surgery is nerve damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This nerve helps the vocal cords move for speech. Nerve problems after thyroid removal are rare. The more experienced the surgeon, the lower the risk of problems. During the surgery, the surgeon may also use a special breathing tube to prevent injury to the nerves.An otolaryngologist will do a ""scope"" procedure to check the vocal cords before and after surgery. The doctor will gently place a small, flexible camera into your child's nose to see the vocal cords and check their function.Vocal cord injuries during surgery are often temporary. But some patients may need a longer recovery time, even a year or longer.

707,"Medulloblastoma is a brain tumor that begins in the cerebellum. The cerebellum is in a part of the brain called the posterior fossa.
Medulloblastoma is the most commonmalignantbrain tumor in children. It begins in thecerebellum, an area in the back of the brain. Medulloblastoma can spread to other parts of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).
About 500 new cases of pediatric medulloblastoma are diagnosed every year in the United States.
In most cases, the cause of medulloblastoma is unknown. But a small number are caused by gene changes that can be passed down in families.
Medulloblastoma is most common in children under 16. Children ages 5–9 are diagnosed the most often. Older teens and adults can be diagnosed with it, too.
Medulloblastoma is divided into 4 main groups, with many subgroups. These groups are based on molecular features of tumor cells:
WNT-activated (pronounced “wint”)
Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-activated
Group 3 (non-WNT/non-SHH)
Group 4 (non-WNT/non-SHH)
The tumor’s group affects the treatment and prognosis. So, molecular testing must be done for an accurate diagnosis.
Treatment for medulloblastoma can include:
Surgeryto remove as much of the tumor as possible
Radiation therapyafter surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells
Chemotherapyalong with surgery and radiation therapy
Medulloblastomas are fast growing. These tumors often spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord.
The overall survival rate for childhood medulloblastoma in the United States is 70–80% (7–8 of 10) if the disease has not spread. If the disease has spread, the survival rate is about 60% (6 of 10).","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/medulloblastoma.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:23.669391', 'title': 'Medulloblastoma in Children and Teens - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is medulloblastoma?', 'super_section': None}"

Nauseaandvomiting
Tiredness or changes in activity levels
Dizziness
Loss of balance, clumsiness
Handwriting problems
Vision changes
If the tumor has spread to the spinal cord, symptoms may include:
Back pain
Problems walking
Problems urinating or change in bowel function
Medulloblastoma is a cerebellar tumor. The cerebellum is in the lower rear part of the brain in a region known as the posterior fossa. Functions of the cerebellum include:
Movement control
Balance
Posture
Coordination
Most medulloblastomas form in the middle of the cerebellum by the 4thventricle. As the tumor grows, it can block the flow of the brain fluid called cerebrospinal fluid. This causes a buildup of fluid within the brain calledhydrocephalus.
The fluid increases pressure on the brain. Many symptoms of medulloblastoma are due to fluid buildup.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/medulloblastoma.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:23.669391', 'title': 'Medulloblastoma in Children and Teens - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Symptoms of medulloblastoma', 'super_section': None}"

730,"Melanoma can occur on any part of the skin.
Melanoma is a type ofskin cancermost often seen in adults. It also affects about 300–400 children and teens each year in the United States. Melanoma can develop on any part of the skin. It can also occur in the eye. If left untreated, melanoma can spread to other parts of the body.
In melanoma, cancer forms in skin cells calledmelanocytes. These cells produce melanin, which provides color (pigment) to the skin.
Melanin helps protect the skin fromultraviolet radiation (UVradiation). People with darker skin have more melanin and are less likely to develop melanoma.
Melanoma accounts for about 1% of cancers in children under age 15. It occurs more often in older age groups.
Symptoms of melanoma include unusual skin changes such as:
A mole that gets bigger, changes color, bleeds, or itches
A pale or red-colored bump
Treatment for melanoma depends on thestageof disease. Patients usually havesurgeryto remove the cancer. More severe disease may require other treatment. This may includetargeted therapy,chemotherapyand/orimmunotherapy.

Other tests may be needed if doctors think melanoma may have spread. These tests include:
Blood tests – These may include checking the level oflactate dehydrogenase(LDH). The LDH level may be higher when melanoma is present.
Lymph node mappingand asentinel lymph node biopsy– These are used to see if melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Doctors inject a special dye or radioactive substance near the melanoma site. The dye travels through thelymphatic systemto the lymph nodes closest to the original tumor. A surgeon can remove those lymph nodes and test them for cancer. This helps doctors find out the disease stage and plan treatments.
Imaging tests– The type of tests depend on the specific tumor and the involvement of lymph nodes. Such tests may includemagnetic resonance imaging(MRI),positron emission tomography(PET) scans, andcomputed tomography(CT or CAT scan).
This PET scan shows the spread of melanoma in a child. Green arrows mark where cancer has spread.

750,"Neuroblastoma is a cancer that grows from cells in the nervous system. It forms when healthy nervous system cells do not develop as they should. Instead, cancer cells called ""neuroblasts"" become stuck in an early stage of development. They do not become healthy, normal cells. The cancer cells begin to grow, and this causes a tumor to form.
Patients with neuroblastoma may have only one tumor. Or neuroblastoma cells may spread to other parts of the body. Neuroblastoma is usually found in children younger than 5. It is the most commonsolid tumorfound outside the brain in children.
Neuroblastoma often starts in the abdomen, either in theadrenal glandor in other nerve cells. It can also form in the neck, chest, or pelvis.
Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor (or tumors if the cancer has spread). The symptoms may include a lump, pain, loss of appetite, tiredness, and irritability.
Some babies with neuroblastoma do not need treatment. The doctor will follow the tumor's progress closely, and sometimes it will go away on its own.
Some children with neuroblastoma needsurgeryonly.
But about half of neuroblastoma patients have high-risk disease. They needchemotherapy,surgery,radiation therapy, andimmunotherapy.

The treatment plan for some types of NHL depends on how the lymphoma responds when treatment begins. This approach is known asrisk-adapted therapy. Doctors choose therapy based on how well cancer responds to treatment.
Patients whose lymphoma responds well to treatment may get fewer medicines and possibly fewer side effects.
Patients whose lymphoma does not respond as well often require stronger therapies.
All patients get medicines and other therapies to help manage side effects.

Scientists are testing drugs to see if they can block the signals that cause certain cancer cells to grow.
In optic pathway gliomas, changes in theBRAFgene are common. These mutations often occur as aBRAFfusion or aBRAFV600E mutation.
Targeted therapies are changing how doctors treat optic pathway gliomas that cannot be completely removed.

About 400 children and teens in the U.S. are found to have osteosarcoma each year.
Osteosarcoma may develop in any bone. But it usually forms in the wide ends of long bones of the leg or arm. It most often begins in immature bone cells that form new bone tissue.
The most common places for osteosarcoma to develop are in the:
Lower part of the thigh bone near the knee
Upper part of the shin
Upper arm bone near the shoulder
It sometimes forms in flat bones such as the pelvis or skull.
In rare cases, osteosarcoma can form in soft tissue other than bone.
Osteosarcomas may form inside the bone or on the outer surface of bone. Most pediatric osteosarcomas are inside the bone.
Osteosarcoma is usually treated withchemotherapyfollowed bysurgery.
Children with a single site of osteosarcoma that can be removed with surgery have a 65–70% chance of long-term cure. Survival rates are lower if the cancer has spread at the time of diagnosis.

833,"Pineoblastoma is a rare brain tumor that may occur in children and young adults. This tumor begins in the pineal gland, a tiny structure found deep in the brain.
About 30% (3 in 10) of all tumors found in the pineal gland are pineoblastomas. Because of their location, these tumors can be hard to treat. Pineoblastoma tumors make up less than 1% of childhood brain tumors. The 5-year survival rate for childhood pineoblastoma ranges from 67–85% in the United States, depending on the type.
The pineal gland releases the hormonemelatonin, which controls sleep. Melatonin also helps control the release ofreproductive hormonesfrom the pituitary gland, such asluteinizing hormone(LH) andfollicle-stimulating hormone(FSH). These hormones are important for fertility and reproductive health. Some treatments for pineoblastoma may affect fertility.

If the disease is not treated, it can spread to other parts of the body and become harder to treat. Patients with hereditary retinoblastoma are at higher risk for other cancers later in life.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/retinoblastoma.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:27.583140', 'title': 'Retinoblastoma in Children and Teens - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is retinoblastoma?', 'super_section': None}"

To the brain
To the bones, bone marrow, and liver
Eye tumors are classified from Group A to Group E.
The group is based on tumor size, location, and extent of spread inside the eye. If both eyes are affected, each eye is classed separately.
Group A tumors are small and away from the center of vision. Patients with Group A tumors have a good chance of maintaining normal eye function and vision during and after treatment.
Group E tumors are large and have broken apart inside the eye (vitreous seeding). These tumors are more likely to spread outside the eye. Children with Group E tumors likely have reduced or complete loss of vision. They have a high risk of losing the eye, even with treatment.
The stage of cancer refers to whether it has spread outside the eye. Stages 1 and 2 mean the tumor is only in the eye. Stages 3 and 4 mean the tumor has spread to tissues around the eye or to other parts of the body.
Tumor Group A
The tumor is small and only in the retina. It is not near important eye structures.
Tumor Group B
The tumor is larger and/or near important eye structures.
Tumor Group C
The tumor is mostly well-defined but has small amounts of spread or seeding.
Tumor Group D
The tumor is large or poorly defined and has a lot of seeding.
Tumor Group E

907,"Chemotherapy, or chemo, uses strong medicines to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Chemo might use 1 medicine or more than 1 medicine.
Chemotherapy for retinoblastoma might include:
Vincristine
Carboplatin
Etoposide
Topotecan
Cyclophosphamide
Doxorubicin
Melphalan
Chemotherapy alone cannot cure retinoblastoma. It is used along with other treatments.
Chemo for retinoblastoma might be given:
Through the vein (intravenous)
Near the eye (periocular)
Directly in the eye (intravitreal)
Through the ophthalmic artery, either by ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) or intra-arterial chemotherapy
OAC should only be done by a medical team with experience in this technique to lower the risk of damage to the eye.
Focal therapy treats the tumor directly. If the tumor is very small, focal therapy alone may be enough to treat the cancer. It is done while the child is asleep under anesthesia. There are 3 types:
Laser therapy:This therapy uses high intensity light or heat to kill cancer cells.
Cryotherapy:This therapy uses freezing and thawing to shrink the tumor and kill the cancer cells.
Plaque radiotherapy (brachytherapy):Surgeons place a small device made of radioactive material on the eye directly above the tumor. The device remains in place for a few days. Surgery with anesthesia is required to place and remove the device. After the device is removed, no radioactivity is left in the eye.
Surgeryis used to remove the eye if necessary. This surgery is called enucleation.
Unilateral retinoblastoma: Most patients (70–90%) with only 1 affected eye do not need more treatment after the eye is removed. If the tumor has spread into tissues around the eye or eye socket, tests includingbone marrow aspirates and biopsiesandlumbar punctureare used to stage the disease. In these cases, patients need chemo because of a higher risk that the tumor will spread.
Bilateral retinoblastoma: If 1 eye is removed, treatment focuses on saving the other eye. Doctors also consider the risk of tumor spread.
Radiation therapymay be used for advanced retinoblastoma.External beam radiationuses a machine to deliver radiation to the entire eye. This is the most aggressive treatment for retinoblastoma. It is used to help the child keep their vision and to prevent the cancer from spreading. Because of the risk of long-term effects and second cancers, radiation is usually only used for patients whose cancer:
Has spread beyond the eye
Has not responded to other therapies
Has come back","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/retinoblastoma.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:27.583140', 'title': 'Retinoblastoma in Children and Teens - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Treatments for localized retinoblastoma', 'super_section': None}"

920,"Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that grows in the body’s soft connective tissue including:
Muscle
Nerves
Tendons
Fat
Walls of blood and lymph vessels
Soft tissue sarcomas account for about 7% of all childhood cancers. They can be divided into 2 main types:
Rhabdomyosarcoma
Non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS)
Soft tissue sarcomas are named for the tissue that they most resemble:
Skeletal muscle: rhabdomyosarcoma
Smooth muscle: leiomyosarcoma
Cartilage: chondrosarcoma
Fat: liposarcoma
Blood and lymph vessels: angiosarcoma
Peripheral nerves: malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
Fibrous tissue: fibrosarcoma
Rhabdomyosarcoma is more common in younger children. NRSTS is more common in teens. These types of cancers can range from local to highly metastatic (spreading through the body).
Certain conditions passed through families can increase risk for soft tissue sarcomas. Children who have been exposed to radiation are also at higher risk. Treatment for soft tissue sarcoma usually includessurgery,chemotherapy, orradiation therapy.
Rhabdomyosarcoma
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma. Until recently, scientists thought that rhabdomyosarcoma grew from immature muscle cells. This is because the tumor cells look like muscle cells under a microscope. However, new research shows that rhabdomyosarcoma can actually grow from immature endothelial cells, cells that would normally develop to line blood vessels.

RhabdomyosarcomaWhat is rhabdomyosarcoma?Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue tumor that often develops in muscle. But it can form anywhere in the body.It is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma. It usually affects children under age 10. It can even develop before birth.There are 2 types of rhabdomyosarcoma:Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma– This tumor is most common in children under age 5 and often forms in the head, neck, bladder, vagina, prostate, or testicles.Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma– This tumor affects all age groups and usually forms in the larger muscles of the arms, legs, and trunk of the body.Symptoms of rhabdomyosarcomaSymptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma depend on the tumor’s location. They can include:Swelling or a lump that does not go away, sometimes painfulHeadachesBulging of the eyeBleeding in the nose, vagina, or rectumConstipation or difficulty urinatingRisk factors of rhabdomyosarcomaCertain factors may increase risk for rhabdomyosarcoma:About 2/3 of rhabdomyosarcoma tumors happen in children under age 10.Rhabdomyosarcoma occurs slightly more often in males than females.White children have a higher risk of rhabdomyosarcoma than Black children.Certaininherited conditionscan increase risk for rhabdomyosarcoma:Li-Fraumeni syndromeDICER1 syndromeNeurofibromatosis type 1Costello syndromeBeckwith-Wiedemann syndromeNoonan syndromeDiagnosis of rhabdomyosarcomaTests and procedures used to diagnose rhabdomyosarcoma include:A health history, physical exam, and blood test to learn about symptoms, general health, past illnesses, and risk factorsImaging tests, such as:AnMRIto assess the primary tumorACT scanto see if rhabdomyosarcoma has spread to the lungs.

This can help doctors better understand the disease. It can also help plan the right treatments.Rhabdomyosarcoma is grouped based on:Tumor locationSpread of diseaseResult of surgeryGroupSpread of diseaseGroup INo disease after surgeryThe tumor is limited to one area and is completely removed with surgery.Group IIMicroscopic disease after surgeryThe tumor is limited to one area and is removed with surgery, but cancer cells are found in nearby tissue that surrounded the tumor (margin) and/or lymph nodes.Group IIISignificant disease after surgeryThe tumor is limited to one area but cannot be completely removed with surgery.Group IVMetastatic diseaseThe tumor has spread to other parts of the body at diagnosis (metastatic).Rhabdomyosarcoma can also be staged using theTNM system. This system considers 3 factors:Tumor (T) – Size and location of the primary tumorNode (N) – Spread of disease to lymph nodesMetastasis (M) – Spread of disease to other parts of the bodyRhabdomyosarcoma can be divided into 4 stages using the TNM system.StageLocationTumor SizeLymph NodesMetastasisWhere is the primary tumor?How large is the tumor?Are cancer cells found in nearby lymph nodes?Has the cancer spread to other parts of the body?1Favorable: Tumor is in the area of the eye, head or neck or in the genitorurinary tractExceptions: Tumor is located near the brain or spinal cord or in the bladder or prostateAny sizeYes or NoNo2Unfavorable: All other sitesLess than 5 cmNoNo3Unfavorable: All other sitesLess than 5 cmGreater than 5 cmYesYes or NoNo4Any siteAny sizeYes or NoYesTreatment of rhabdomyosarcomaRhabdomyosarcoma requires a combination of treatments. These can include:ChemotherapySurgeryRadiation therapyAll children will have chemotherapy as part of rhabdomyosarcoma treatment. This helps treat microscopic spread of the cancer.Tumors that can be seen on imaging tests may be treated with a combination of surgery and radiation therapy.Surgerywill remove the tumor when possible. A small amount of tissue around the tumor and nearby lymph nodes is removed, too.Chemotherapyuses powerful medicines to kill cancer cells. Or it may stop them from growing. Most chemotherapy is given through injections. Sometimes it is given by mouth.Chemotherapy before surgery is to help make the tumor smaller.Chemotherapy after surgery is to kill any remaining cancer cells and to help keep the tumor from coming back.Radiation therapymay be used to treat rhabdomyosarcoma in combination with chemotherapy and/or surgery. Radiation uses high energy particles to kill or stop the growth of cancer cells. Radiation therapy is the main treatment for metastatic disease in rhabdomyosarcoma.Other treatments include:targeted therapies(these are rare)immunotherapy.Prognosis ofrhabdomyosarcomaThe chance of recovery from rhabdomyosarcoma depends on:Size and location of the tumorLarger tumors are more difficult to treat. These are tumors that are greater than 5 centimeters (cm).Some tumors have a better outlook based on location. Tumors generally have a higher chance of cure when they are in the:Eye areaHead and neck (except if they are near the membranes of the brain or spinal cord)Genital or urinary tract (except in the bladder or prostate)Bile ductsPatient age (younger and older patients tend to do worse)Type of rhabdomyosarcoma: Embryonal tumors tend to have a better outcome than alveolar tumors.Whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the bodyThe ability of surgery to completely remove the tumorRisk groupsDoctors classify rhabdomyosarcoma patients into risk groups to help plan treatments.Low Risk– Patients with low-risk disease have an embryonal tumor that can be completely removed with surgery or a tumor around the eye that cannot be removed.Intermediate Risk– Patients with intermediate or medium-risk disease have:An embryonal tumor that is not completely removed with surgeryAn alveolar tumor that has not spread to distant parts of the body.High Risk– Patients with high-risk disease have cancer that has spread, or stage 4 disease.Risk classification helps doctors decide:What treatments to useDose of medicationNumber of treatmentsIf rhabdomyosarcoma comes back, the prognosis may be affected by:Where in the body the cancer came backHow much time passed between the original cancer and its returnWhat therapies were originally used to treat the cancerChildren with rhabdomyosarcoma that has not spread have greater than 70% chance of long-term cure. About 20% of patients have disease that has already spread at diagnosis.If the cancer has already spread at diagnosis, the chance of survival is less than 30%.About 30% of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma will have disease that returns after treatment. The disease may return at the location of the initial tumor or in other sites.Recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma is difficult to treat. The chance of cure is low.Clinical trialsmay be an option.Balancing quality of life with cancer-directed therapy is important.

Spread of disease
Result of surgery
Rhabdomyosarcoma can also be staged using theTNM system. This system considers 3 factors:
Tumor (T) – Size and location of the primary tumor
Node (N) – Spread of disease to lymph nodes
Metastasis (M) – Spread of disease to other parts of the body

926,"Rhabdomyosarcoma requires a combination of treatments. These can include:
Chemotherapy
Surgery
Radiation therapy
All children will have chemotherapy as part of rhabdomyosarcoma treatment. This helps treat microscopic spread of the cancer.
Tumors that can be seen on imaging tests may be treated with a combination of surgery and radiation therapy.
Surgerywill remove the tumor when possible. A small amount of tissue around the tumor and nearby lymph nodes is removed, too.
Chemotherapyuses powerful medicines to kill cancer cells. Or it may stop them from growing. Most chemotherapy is given through injections. Sometimes it is given by mouth.Chemotherapy before surgery is to help make the tumor smaller.Chemotherapy after surgery is to kill any remaining cancer cells and to help keep the tumor from coming back.

Type of rhabdomyosarcoma: Embryonal tumors tend to have a better outcome than alveolar tumors.
Whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body
The ability of surgery to completely remove the tumor
Doctors classify rhabdomyosarcoma patients into risk groups to help plan treatments.
Low Risk– Patients with low-risk disease have an embryonal tumor that can be completely removed with surgery or a tumor around the eye that cannot be removed.
Intermediate Risk– Patients with intermediate or medium-risk disease have:An embryonal tumor that is not completely removed with surgeryAn alveolar tumor that has not spread to distant parts of the body.
An embryonal tumor that is not completely removed with surgery
An alveolar tumor that has not spread to distant parts of the body.
High Risk– Patients with high-risk disease have cancer that has spread, or stage 4 disease.
Risk classification helps doctors decide:
What treatments to use
Dose of medication
Number of treatments
If rhabdomyosarcoma comes back, the prognosis may be affected by:
Where in the body the cancer came back
How much time passed between the original cancer and its return
What therapies were originally used to treat the cancer
Children with rhabdomyosarcoma that has not spread have greater than 70% chance of long-term cure. About 20% of patients have disease that has already spread at diagnosis.
If the cancer has already spread at diagnosis, the chance of survival is less than 30%.
About 30% of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma will have disease that returns after treatment. The disease may return at the location of the initial tumor or in other sites.
Recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma is difficult to treat. The chance of cure is low.Clinical trialsmay be an option.
Balancing quality of life with cancer-directed therapy is important. Talk to your care team about what problems to expect and ways to help manage them.
Non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS)What is non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma?A non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS) is a tumor that develops in the body’s soft tissues.

941,"Thyroid nodules are lumps of abnormal cells that grow in the thyroid gland. Most thyroid nodules are benign. This means they are not cancerous.
Thyroid cancer, also called thyroid carcinoma, is rare in children and teens. About 2% of thyroid cancers in the U.S. occur in people under age 20. About 25% of thyroid nodules found in children and teens are cancerous (malignant).
The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located at the base of the throat in the front of the neck. It has 2 lobes: 1 on the right and 1 on the left.
The thyroid gland is part of the body's endocrine system. It makes the hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones control body functions such as temperature, appetite, growth, and energy level. A hormone made in the brain called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) controls T3 and T4 blood levels.
The thyroid makes T3 and T4 hormones using iodine from the diet and a thyroid protein calledthyroglobulin(Tg). Both healthy and cancerous thyroid tissue make this thyroglobulin protein. Doctors can monitor the level of thyroglobulin in the blood to find any new thyroid cancer after treatment.

962,"Talking about a child’s death with other children can be one of the hardest things for parents to do. Parents must consider each child's ability to understand death and its permanence. How a child processes this information depends on several factors. These include age, stage of development, and life experiences.
These conversations are not easy. But parents can do some things to begin the discussions.
Speak honestly and directly. Use simple words such as “died” instead of “passed on” or “passed away.” Parents often want to soften what they say. But this can sometimes make children more confused and uncertain.
Explain death as simply as possible in language your child can understand. Some children think death is not permanent. You might say, “When someone dies, it means their body does not work anymore. They cannot talk or walk or eat or sleep or play…”
Avoid using phrases such as “God took him to heaven” or “She is with Grandma now.”
Repeat the same details several times in different ways. Check to see what children understand and what fears they may have. For example, you might say, “Which part are you thinking about the most?” or “I just said a lot of things. What did you hear?”
Think of the first conversations as only a beginning step. Offer only as much detail as the child asks for or seems ready for. Reassure children that it is OK to talk about death, and that it is OK to ask questions.
Give children space to process information. Be there when children are ready to talk. Some children will raise the subject themselves or give small hints that they want to talk. Others might need several tries before they are ready to share what they are thinking and feeling.
Talk about feelings. Children often follow parents' lead in bringing up a subject. If parents share their feelings, children are more likely to talk about their own thoughts and feelings.

It is important for children to have a sense of what will happen. This can lessen their questions and worries.
Help children process their emotions and discuss how to respond to others' emotions. Encourage constructive expression even when feelings are difficult to share. For example, “I see how hurt and angry you are. When you feel that way, it is OK to punch a pillow, but it is not OK to punch your friends.”
Let them know that their feelings are normal and that everyone deals with grief differently.
As much as possible, let children know what will happen ahead of time. Reassure them that they will be taken care of.

976,"The terms “funeral services” and “memorial services” are different. A funeral service is a gathering before burial or cremation with the body present. A memorial service can take place at any time.
Usual goals of services:
Gather family and friends together to remember a life
Express sorrow and begin healing
Provide support to one another
Families may choose to have more than 1 gathering. For example, a family may have a small graveside funeral service and then a larger memorial service later.
Factors to consider include:
Family and religious preferences
Time and travel issues
The number of people who will attend
Costs

977,"Families say that there are some ways to help make planning easier.
Ask for help:You will need help. Family members or close friends can help manage visitors, make phone calls, and take care of other needs. Families also need help from someone who can explain planning details. This person is often a funeral home director. Take a close friend or family member with you to the funeral home. It is hard to make decisions under grief and stress.Asocial workeror hospice care expert can help with planning. Many families also include a minister or spiritual leader to help plan and lead the service.
Focus on what is most important for your family:A funeral or memorial service is a way to remember the special life of your child. Personalize the service in ways that are most meaningful to your family. Some families want to be involved in every part of the planning process. Other families may focus on 1 or 2 things that are most important to them. Let people know your family’s priorities.
Take it step by step:You have many things to do. Grief and stress make it hard to think. A planning guide or checklist can help.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/emotional-support-daily-life/bereavement/planning-a-funeral.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:29.743192', 'title': 'How to Plan a Child’s Funeral or Memorial Service  - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Tips to help plan a child’s funeral or memorial service', 'super_section': None}"
978,"Finding special ways to celebrate the child’s life is important. It can help families and friends find comfort and honor your child.
You can include personal elements. Examples include:
Photo and memory displays
Eulogies by friends and family members
Tribute videos
Specific music or readings
I have a beautiful strand of purple beads created from the flowers at Catie’s funeral. A friend gathered all the flowers after the funeral and sent them to a company that turned the flowers into beads. As each of our girls reached the age of seven, we gave them a special necklace or bracelet made from Catie’s flowers. Each of them treasures a happy memory today from a sad day that they really don’t remember due to their young age. I even have one set of white beads for our son; maybe one day he will find someone special for his beads.
Christine, mom to Catie
Families often look for ways to include personal items that pay tribute to their child's:
Special talents or traits
Interests, activities, or hobbies
Awards and accomplishments
Important people and places
Toys or possessions that hold meaning
Stories and specific memories
Favorite songs, books, sayings, or verses","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/emotional-support-daily-life/bereavement/planning-a-funeral.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:29.743192', 'title': 'How to Plan a Child’s Funeral or Memorial Service  - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Ways to honor your child’s legacy', 'super_section': None}"
979,"One question many families have is whether the child should be involved in planning his or her own service. Many families find comfort in having their child help plan the service.
Children may hold strong preferences and want to take part in planning. Whether families include children in the planning process depends on:
Family preferences
The child’s age and maturity
The child’s health status
Prognosis
Talking about what happens after death and what the memorial service could look like is sometimes a source of hope and comfort. It can help take away some of the unknown. It can give children some control over what will happen. This can also provide a way for families to connect and create memories.
Ways to involve children include:
Clothing:Some children prefer that family and friends wear casual clothes or a certain color at the service. Some children and teens may have ideas about how they want clothes or makeup to be done.
Food:Favorite foods may offer a comforting way of remembering loved ones. Some children may want their favorite food at a reception.
Music:Many children have favorite songs or performances they would like during the service or at gatherings.
Speakers and eulogies:Children may want certain people to tell stories at their service.
Photos and special objects:Children may want to help pick out photos and objects to display on a memory table. This can also give families a chance to talk about memories of events and people who are important in their lives.
Ways to be remembered:Children may want to select ways that they would like to be remembered. These can include donations to certain charities or activities.
It is also a good idea to give siblings the choice to be involved in planning. Many siblings find comfort in having a specific “job” for the service such as choosing a song or handing out programs. Keep in mind that children may change their mind. That is OK.

980,"Planning a child’s funeral is extremely difficult. Knowing the steps involved and what to ask can help.
Type of service:Religious and family traditions often guide planning the type of service or ceremony. Services often include 1 or more of the following:Visitation, wake, or viewingTraditional funeral serviceGraveside or scattering ceremonyMemorial service after burial or cremationReception or fellowship mealGathering of family and friends
Visitation, wake, or viewing
Traditional funeral service
Graveside or scattering ceremony
Memorial service after burial or cremation
Reception or fellowship meal
Gathering of family and friends
Location:Most services are held at a church, funeral home, or a community facility such as a school auditorium or graveside. Some people choose a home funeral or a place that may have meaning to the child or family.
Service participants:Families will need to decide who should be part of the service. These people often include spiritual leaders, family members, friends, or representatives of the school or other social and activity groups. There may be some limitations to who or how many people can take part in a funeral or memorial service.
Private moments:Families can decide to have private moments or limit attendance to services. Funeral homes and churches often have special rooms reserved only for family and close friends.
Other important decisions to consider include:
Date and time:There is no legal time limit for completing a service. Families can choose what is best for them. Some spiritual practices require the service to take place within a certain length of time. Also, families might consider whether people need time to travel to an out-of-town service.
Telling friends and family:The obituary or death notice in a local newspaper and funeral home website is often how people learn about the details for a funeral or memorial service. Friends and family may also share the obituary on social media, email, and phone calls.
Caring for other children:It can be helpful to assign a sitter or family member to care for children during the service. Some facilities may offer sitting services. Consider having a children’s room on site where adults can take children who need a break. It is a good idea to assign a close friend or family members to each sibling. They can step away with the child if they need time alone.
Recording the service:Families may want to plan to have the service recorded. A family’s distress can make it hard to remember the day.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/emotional-support-daily-life/bereavement/planning-a-funeral.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:29.743192', 'title': 'How to Plan a Child’s Funeral or Memorial Service  - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Decisions to consider in planning a child’s funeral or memorial service', 'super_section': None}"

985,"The simple presence of another person can be a comfort. Being there can mean many things. The most important thing is to show that you care.
When talking to a family member, ask that person how they are doing today. Adding “today” to the question allows the grieving person to answer the question rather than hiding behind a pleasantry. Do not be afraid to ask. Be ready to listen.
Do not forget to ask siblings how they are doing. People often ask siblings how their parents are doing. Also, people sometimes ask parents how the other parent is doing. Every person in the family is grieving.
Family members may want to spend time doing something “normal,” such as going on a walk, out to dinner, or to a movie. Do not worry if you do not know the “right” thing to say or do—just be there.
How you can help a grieving family:
Be there.
Talk less. Listen more.
Remember the child.
Accept that all emotions and responses are normal. Do not negate feelings in an attempt to comfort.
Offer specific and practical help.
Keep track of meaningful dates.

Do household chores, such as laundry, house cleaning, or taking care of the family’s yard.

990,"Losing a child to cancer is not something any family forgets. The grief process is lifelong. Most support comes in the early weeks and months.
In the months and years after a child’s death, certain days will be more difficult for families—holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, or other special days. Keeping track of these dates and offering support can be a good way to help a bereaved family over time.
Simply checking in on the date can be comforting. A simple text saying, “I am thinking of you today,” can mean a lot. Offering to bring food or help with a specific task on or before the significant date may also be a comfort. But know that these invitations may not be accepted.

Help them keep their regular routines.
Invite them to special outings—the movies, the beach, a baseball game.
Understand that like adults, the sibling’s grief process may be long. Continue to extend invitations and show your support.

Handwrite the note if possible
Keep it simple
Be sincere and authentic
Share memories and make a personal connection
Avoid giving advice
Be careful about sharing religious beliefs
Use a calendar to remind you to follow up with phone calls or help.

This helps families know that they and their children are not forgotten.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/emotional-support-daily-life/bereavement/writing-a-condolence-letter.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:30.746357', 'title': 'How to Write a Condolence Letter - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Tips for writing condolence letters', 'super_section': None}"

Begin with a simple acknowledgement of the loss. Be sincere and express your feelings of sympathy.
Refer to the deceased by name. Identify your connection to the child.“I wanted to share how very sorry we are for your loss. Aiden was in theater at school with my daughter Sophia.”""I am heartbroken for the loss your family has suffered. It was a joy to have Luke in my class during third grade.”

Be personal and refer to the deceased and other family members by name
Share how the child or family have had an impact on you or your family
Acknowledge special characteristics or qualities of the child and their family

1010,"The close of a condolence letter is often where help is offered. If you are unsure what to offer, simply express care and support.
When offering help:
Be specific in the help you offer. Instead of saying, “Please let us know if we can help in any way,” say, “We have signed up to bring you a meal and will drop it off next Tuesday.”
Only offer help if you have the ability to follow through. If you are unable to commit to helping in a specific way, sincere words of concern and care are enough.
Check in with the family’s support community to find outwhat types of help might be needed.“We are happy to help take Tyler to soccer whenever he needs a ride. Our hearts break for your entire family. We are thinking of each of you.”“I hope that you will find strength in the love of your church family. We are praying for you.”
“We are happy to help take Tyler to soccer whenever he needs a ride. Our hearts break for your entire family. We are thinking of each of you.”
“I hope that you will find strength in the love of your church family. We are praying for you.”
The final sentence of a condolence letter can sometimes feel as difficult as the first. End with an expression of hope or sympathy. Sample closings include:
“I will keep you in my prayers.” (Only if true)
“I hope you feel surrounded by much love.”
“I’m holding you close in my thoughts.”
“With love always” (If close to the family)
“I will call you next week to see when I can come over and help.” (If you plan to follow through)
“With sympathy”","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/emotional-support-daily-life/bereavement/writing-a-condolence-letter.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:30.746357', 'title': 'How to Write a Condolence Letter - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Condolence letter ending', 'super_section': None}"

A variety of resources are available for grieving families including websites, support groups, books, and online communities. Because each person has different needs and coping styles, what is helpful for one family member might not be helpful for another. Needs can also change over time.

To find local support groups in a particular area, search online using keywords such as “grief support groups in (town).”

In the body, chemical signals control how cells grow and divide. When cells become damaged or old, they die. Healthy cells take their place.
In cancer, the chemical signals do not work properly. Cancer cells grow and multiply when they should stop. Cancer cells can push out healthy cells and make it hard for the body to function as it should.

1028,"Every cell gets information from genes. Cancer begins with a change within the genes of a single cell. These changes are called mutations.
Most mutations are harmless. But sometimes these mutations change the control of cell growth.
Lifestyle and environmental factors do not cause pediatric cancers as they do with some adult cancers. Childhood cancers result from gene mutations that happen by chance.
Mutations usually happen as mistakes when cells divide.
Viruses cause some mutations. These viruses includehuman papillomavirus (HPV)and thehepatitis B and C viruses.
Children sometimes inherit gene mutations from their parents.
Learn aboutgenetic testing for cancer or other diseases.

1030,"Many cancers form masses or clumps of cells. These clumps make up a solid tumor. Other cancers, such as leukemia, travel in the blood and do not form masses.
As solid tumors grow, some cells may travel to other parts of the body. This is calledmetastasis.
Cancer may also spread to nearby tissue.
The place where cancer starts is called the primary tumor. Metastatic cancer is named after the original tumor. For example,osteosarcomathat starts in bone and spreads to the lung is called metastatic osteosarcoma, not lung cancer.
Cancer cells often have features that help them to grow. They may divide more quickly than normal cells or simply not stop dividing when they are supposed to. Some cancer cells continue to develop new gene mutations that can cause them to multiply faster.
As cancer cells grow and move into healthy tissue, tumors can press on blood vessels, nerves, and body parts. The cancer cells can crowd healthy cells. This may prevent the body from working as it should.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/what-is-cancer.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:31.208145', 'title': 'Understanding Cancer - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'How cancer grows and moves', 'super_section': None}"

1080,"A person with an inherited risk for cancer has a higher likelihood of developing cancer due to gene changes that may be passed down (inherited) from their parents.
Genes are sections ofDNAthat carry important instructions that tell cells how to grow and function. Genes determine features such as hair and eye color.
A mutation is a change in a gene that affects how the gene works. Some mutations may make it more likely to get cancer. A person may be the first in the family to have the mutation. Or they may have inherited the gene change from 1 or both parents.
An inherited risk for cancer means a person has a greater chance of developing the disease. But it does not mean that the person will always develop cancer.
About 10–15% of children with cancer carry a gene change that is linked to an inherited risk for cancer.

1088,"Just before beginning her 9th grade school year, Lindsey, now 29, attended a back-to-school party to meet her new classmates. But she knew she wouldn’t get to hang out with them, at least not that year.
That’s because Lindsey had just learned her acute lymphoblastic leukemia had come back. She was originally diagnosed when she was 9 years old.
“There are lots of fears associated with relapse since obviously the first treatment didn't cure the cancer,” Lindsey said. “Initially it was hard because I knew going into it some of what I was up against again – social isolation, physical restrictions, needle pokes, higher risk for infections, hair loss, nausea, and vomiting. I no longer had ‘ignorance is bliss’.”
When cancer comes back, this occurrence is called relapse or recurrence.
When cancer recurs, parents, patients (when old enough), and the care team must make decisions about the next course of treatment. Families must also deal with the emotions stirred after learning of the relapse. Common reactions are anxiety, fear, anger, grief, and sadness.
Feelings of guilt are also common but often not warranted, said Erica Kaye, MD, a pediatric oncologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Parents may think they are somehow at fault. It is also normal to question the care team. The reality is that certain types of cancer just don’t respond well to treatment.
“Sometimes, even when everyone does everything right, the cancer still grows,” Dr. Kaye said. “It’s nobody’s fault.”
When cancer recurs, the family and care team members work together to decide upon a new treatment plan.
In Lindsey’s case, she missed her 9th grade year to begin another 2 1/2 years of chemotherapy treatments. She kept up with school the best she could. Lindsey returned to school during her 10th grade year. She later graduated from high school and began nursing school at Brigham Young University- Idaho.
During her second year of college, she relapsed again. This time, she underwent ahematopoietic cell transplant(also known as bone marrow or stem cell transplant), which saved her life. Now an oncology nurse, she is married and has twin daughters.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/relapse/when-childhood-cancer-comes-back.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:35.121442', 'title': 'When Childhood Cancer Comes Back - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'When Childhood Cancer Comes Back - Together by St. Jude™', 'super_section': None}"
1089,"When relapse occurs, families must make several medical decisions.
Parents are the experts on their children and what they need, said Traci Adams, a pediatric oncology social worker at St. Jude.
“This time parents have experience dealing with cancer. It may be helpful to draw on that,” Adams said.
The care team will ask families what their treatment goals are. Of course, every parent wants his or her child to be cured.
“We always affirm their goals and share that we are hoping for cure alongside them,” Dr. Kaye said. “In addition to hoping for a cure. We also ask ‘What else are you hoping for? And what else?’ This allows us to truly understand how best to help the patient and family make each day as good as possible.”
Relapse means different things in the context of different disease processes and different individual and family circumstances, preferences, and goals, Dr. Kaye said. Treatment options may vary based on several factors such as the type of cancer, prior medical treatments, and the level of advanced disease. In some cases, there will be treatment options that can result in cure. In other cases, the chance of cure may be small.
If there are no further treatment options that can cure the cancer, there still are therapies that allow children to live as well as possible for as long as possible. No matter the predicted outcome (prognosis), parents and patients are encouraged to think about what would create the best possible treatment experience.
“Once I started treatment, I felt like I was in control,” Lindsey said. “For me that made it easier. I couldn’t change my diagnosis, but I could control how I was going to handle it.”","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/relapse/when-childhood-cancer-comes-back.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:35.121442', 'title': 'When Childhood Cancer Comes Back - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Medical decisions', 'super_section': None}"
1090,"Parents are encouraged to include patients in the conversation, whenever possible. Sometimes patients as young as 7 may be able to make certain decisions. Other times, an older child may be less emotionally capable to participate in decision-making discussions. In both cases, a child life specialist can help with explaining matters in child-friendly terms.
It is normal for younger children to think that the cancer came back because they did or said something wrong (“magical thinking”). Whenever possible, it is important to reassure the child that they are not to blame for the disease recurrence.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/relapse/when-childhood-cancer-comes-back.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:35.121442', 'title': 'When Childhood Cancer Comes Back - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Include children in decisions when possible', 'super_section': None}"
1091,"It is important to consider theside effectsof different treatments. Sometimes families may want to try the most aggressive treatments available in hopes of a cure.
However, these options may cause serious side effects that could significantly harm a patient’s quality of life. There may be options available that involve fewer side effects.
If the hospital offers a palliative care team, this group of expert clinicians can be very helpful in the development of a treatment plan that is personalized to the patient’s and family’s needs, goals, and wishes. Palliative care focuses on treating symptoms, providing comfort, helping with difficult decision-making, assisting with care coordination (for example, to receive services and resources at home, instead of traveling to the hospital), and focusing on trying to make every day as good as possible. Palliative care is not exclusive to end-of-life care; rather, it is an important part of a cure-directed treatment.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/relapse/when-childhood-cancer-comes-back.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:35.121442', 'title': 'When Childhood Cancer Comes Back - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Side effects', 'super_section': None}"
1092,"Everyone has different preferences about the location of treatment. Some patients prefer not to be at the hospital and wish to receive treatment at home. Others prefer to go to a clinic or to be admitted in the hospital.
Questions to ask include:
Is it possible for my child to receive mostly outpatient care? Is inpatient care an option?
Do we want to be closer to home this time or is it possible to travel to a cancer center further away for treatments?
Does my child want to be close to family and friends? Friends and social activities are especially meaningful to older children, teens, and young adults.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/relapse/when-childhood-cancer-comes-back.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:35.121442', 'title': 'When Childhood Cancer Comes Back - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Location of treatment', 'super_section': None}"
1093,"Families are encouraged to consider the needs of the patient, parents, siblings, and extended family members when making decisions.
Lindsey’s mother was no longer able to be a stay-at-home mom to her 4 children because she went with Lindsey to her treatments. Her father, a physician, had a busy schedule. Her siblings often stayed with family members and friends when necessary.
“It really flips your whole family around,” Lindsey said.
Keeping things as “normal” as possible is often very important. Kids typically need structure and routines.
Parents are encouraged to be practical.
Things to consider include:
School: How will treatment decisions affect the patient’s and sibling’s ability to attend school or participate in school activities?
Work: What options are available to parents to take leave from work to care for their child?
Travel: What impact will travel have on other children and family members?
Child Care: What child care arrangements need to be made for other children in the family? Who will care for the other children when the patient is having outpatient treatments? What will happen if the patient has to be admitted to the hospital and there are other children that need care as well?
Home Care: Do parents need help with housework, laundry, lawn care, checking the mail, and other details? Consider asking a family member or friend to help.
Money: Think about financial concerns such as paying bills like rent or mortgage, utilities, groceries, household items, and car payments. Ask to speak with a social worker if your family is experiencing financial stressors.
Clothing: If traveling to another area for treatment, pack clothing and personal items for several weeks (or months, when applicable). Keep in mind the length of time you and your child will be away from home. You may need to accommodate clothing for different seasons or a different climate if traveling far from your home.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/relapse/when-childhood-cancer-comes-back.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:35.121442', 'title': 'When Childhood Cancer Comes Back - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Siblings and other family', 'super_section': None}"
1094,"Dealing with relapse may add an additional emotional burden that wasn’t there the first time, Adams said. The feelings may be more intense or different than before. The care team, including social workers, chaplains, and psychologists, can help families find ways to deal with emotions and stress.
St. Jude psychologist Kendra Parris, PhD, has these recommendations:
Make time to enjoy favorite activities
Find a time and a place to relax
Practice relaxation techniques such as meditation
Participate in support community such as parent mentors, a faith-based small group, or a gathering of good friends who will listen without judgment

1095,"It is very common for patients and family members to question their faith when a relapse occurs.
“Sometimes parents feel disappointed with God and a real sense of abandonment,” St. Jude chaplain Mark Brown said.
Often families express disappointment that they worked so hard to get through the first treatment experience only to be let down when they learn cancer has returned.
“When the news gets bad and keeps getting worse, it tears up our faith infrastructure. It upends it,” said Brent Powell, director of spiritual care services at St. Jude. “When families first get the diagnosis, they build a hopeful foundation upon which they can stand. The news of relapse can break apart that foundation. It’s like ‘Why has God brought us this far only to let us down now’?”
It is helpful to come to terms with the fact that life can be unpredictable and uncontrollable, Brown said.
“There is mystery. ‘I’m not going to know in an ultimate sense what this means. All I know is this is devastating’,” Brown said. “There may not be an answer to why this thing happened.”","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/relapse/when-childhood-cancer-comes-back.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:35.121442', 'title': 'When Childhood Cancer Comes Back - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Spiritual questions', 'super_section': None}"
1096,"Looking back on her experience, Lindsey recommends searching for the good in each situation. While she knew treatment would be tough, she also remembered the positives.
“Everything had a purpose even though it wasn’t fair,” Lindsey said. “Look for the blessings. Our family grew stronger.”
That attitude changed her outlook on life. She is more appreciative of the little things.
“Maybe you have one day when the pain is a little better or you can eat a few little bits of food,” Lindsey said. “You celebrate every little victory. If you have a bad day, that’s OK. It’s normal to have negative emotions for a time and healthy to vent. But try not to make every day miserable. Rather, look for the positive in each day. Seeing the positives and miracles in a day will change how you view your situation at the present time and provide fond lasting memories of the past.”
Dr. Kaye recommends that families find ways to create memories together. Focus on finding something to enjoy together each day, even if just a small thing. Create special items, such as fingerprint art or hand molds. If possible, take a special trip. If this is not possible, then the palliative care team often can help families find creative ways to spend time together in or around the hospital.
Make every day as good as it can be.
“It is important to be mindful of how precious every day is, for all of us,” Dr. Kaye said. “It’s meaningful to capture memories and make each day as good as possible, no matter the outcome of treatment.”","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/cancers/relapse/when-childhood-cancer-comes-back.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T18:09:35.121442', 'title': 'When Childhood Cancer Comes Back - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Making every day the best possible', 'super_section': None}"

1099,"When Lindsey’s leukemia came back after it had been in remission, she turned to others to help her through the tough times –God, family, friends, hospital staff, and the community as a whole.
Now 29, Lindsey was first diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia when she was 9. The cancer relapsed during her freshman year in high school. Then she relapsed again during college and underwent a hematopoietic cell transplant (also called bone marrow or stem cell transplant). She has been free of cancer ever since.
There will be difficult times during cancer treatment, Lindsey said. But patients and families can find strength while weathering life’s storms.
“I got down and had my pity days, but as a whole, I was able to see many blessings from my experiences, that it helped me push through the hard times,” Lindsey said. “Some days you may get news you don’t want. Take it day by day. The next day could be better. Celebrate each improvement, no matter how small it may be. Some people get overwhelmed and wonder how they’re going to make it. There are so many people who want to help you. Somehow the impossible becomes possible and things slowly piece together.”
Her cancer journey taught Lindsey meaningful lessons:
Going through difficulties can bring families closer together: “You can’t do it alone. You have to unite as a family. My siblings would be there cheering me up. My parents were with my every step of the way. We made our home wherever we were together. As a family we grew really strong. To this day we’re really tight.”
Keeping busy can take your mind off your troubles: “Get out, go on a walk, but don’t sit in your room and sulk. You may want some alone time to absorb things or have days where you feel down. That’s perfectly normal. But try not to lay in bed and sulk in your room all day every day because you’re only going to feel worse.”The hospital likely has many activities for a variety of interests. Child life specialists can help. You may have to think ""outside the box"" to actives to fit your situation, but it is still possible to have fun in the hospital, Lindsey said. Develop new hobbies and interests. Decorate your hospital room to make it feel like home, play games, and invite healthy friends over to keep you company.
Reach out to others at the hospital: “I found a lot of other kids of all ages at the hospital that I bonded with,” Lindsey said. Other patients and families can easily relate to your feelings. Together you support and strengthen each other. You can be a joy to someone else in need, and they can brighten you on a low day. Most hospitals have activities for different age groups such as preteens, teens, and young adults. Take advantage of these activities as they are a wonderful opportunity to meet other kids in a similar situation.”
Lindsey made friends with a 5-year-old girl while she was in the transplant unit.
“We would meet in the halls and walk laps together,” Lindsey said. “I was 19, she was 5, but that age difference didn’t matter! We cheered each other up. Often her mom would lift her up to the window on my door, so she could see me. Seeing her face and her wave outside my door brightened my day!”
People in your community want to help: “There’s so much support out there,” Lindsey said. “You just have to see it.” Tell family and friends what you need such as meals, child care, running errands, or housecleaning. People want to help and it’s easier on them if they know exactly what would be of most aid. It may be easier for the parent to find a go-to person they are close to who can coordinate offers of help for your family.
If you lose your hair, don’t worry so much about it: “When people see that you’re bald they know you’re going through something,” Lindsey said. “Think of it as a badge of courage. You’re a warrior. Though it may be hard to recognize at the time, hair loss is only temporary.”
You can get wigs in many different colors and styles. Depending on what you choose, you can pick a completely different look.
“Not many people can change their hair around that quickly depending on their mood or outfit for the day!” Lindsey said.
Lindsey is now an oncology nurse. She is married and the mother of twins who are 20 months old. She is pregnant with her third child at the time of this writing.
“We have no guarantee what will happen the next day, even as perfectly healthy individuals,” Lindsey said. “Make memories every day, so you can look back and see joy along the journey. Sure there will be hard and sad days while going through treatment. But live so that you can look back on the experience as a whole being able to see some blessings along the way, no matter the outcome.”

1101,"Evan's Story
The news hit Evan’s family like a sucker punch.
Some 4 years after Evan, now 20, was diagnosed withosteosarcoma, the family returned to the hospital in 2017 for another follow-up visit. Previous checkups had revealed no evidence of cancer. But at this visit they learned the cancer had relapsed (returned), this time in Evan’s lungs. He also had developed a second cancer,acute myeloid leukemia.
As devastating as the news of cancer was the first time, the words cut deeper the second time the family heard them.
“When you hear your child has cancer, it’s like a kick in the gut,” said Evan’s father, Tim. “When you hear it a second time, it’s the same emotions all over again. The second time is hardest.”
Evan was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in his left leg in May 2012. He was 13. He underwent chemotherapy to shrink the tumor. Surgeons then removed the remaining tumor from his leg, a procedure known as limb-sparing surgery. He went on to graduate high school. He began college with plans to pursue a career in nursing.
When cancer returned, Evan responded with the most powerful defense he could think of – a positive attitude.
“Being positive is the biggest weapon,” Evans said. “I had been through it once. I knew what I was up against. At the same time, it’s not as hard. The first time I didn’t know anybody. The second time I knew the staff. Some of the same families were still around. We had a support system in place.”
The second time around he had chemotherapy followed by a hematopoietic cell transplant (also known as a bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant.) This treatment requires several weeks in the hospital and a lengthy recovery period after being discharged.
For Cindy, Evan’s mother, the prospect of facing cancer again was daunting.
“You take a deep breath after 4 years,” Cindy said. “And then ‘boom’ not only is the osteosarcoma back, but he has leukemia and needs a transplant. All of the emotions that you feel like had subsided come back. Learning your child has cancer is the absolute worst thing you can hear about your child. To hear it once is bad. To hear it twice, I don’t know if there are words that can describe it.”
At first she wanted to keep to herself and avoid making new friends at the hospital. She thought it would be easier.
But Cindy soon learned that she found strength through her faith and in her connections to others. The family’s church and pastor provided much needed support. People sent care packages, which meant a lot. She cherished the friendships the family made with care team members and other families going through similar experiences.
“You form bonds, relationships, and support,” Cindy said. “Don’t close yourself off.”
Evan recommends always looking for the good in each situation.
“No matter what the day holds,” Evan said. “Choose to find something positive.”
