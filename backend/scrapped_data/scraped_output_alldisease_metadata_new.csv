9,"Aplastic anemia is a rare blood disorder that occurs when bone marrow does not make enough blood cells. It is a type of bone marrow failure.
Bone marrow has blood-forming stem cells that become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
Bone marrowis the soft, spongy tissue at the center of your bones. Stem cells in the bone marrow make new blood cells includingred blood cells,white blood cells, andplatelets.
Most often, all 3 types of blood cells are affected (pancytopenia). This causes:
Low red blood cells, which carry oxygen (anemia)
Low white blood cells, which fight infections (leukopenia orneutropenia)
Low platelets, which help the blood to clot and stop bleeding (thrombocytopenia)","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/blood-disorders/aplastic-anemia.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:33:26.371774', 'title': 'Aplastic Anemia - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is aplastic anemia?', 'super_section': None}"

13,"Aplastic anemia is a type of bone marrow failure. In most cases, aplastic anemia is acquired (not inherited from parents). It is also called idiopathic aplastic anemia.
Acquired aplastic anemia results from an immune system attack and destruction of blood-forming stem cells in the bone marrow. When this happens, the body makes fewer blood cells. The cause for the faulty immune response is not known.
Rarely, aplastic anemia can also be caused by certain viral infections, being around toxic chemicals, taking certain medicines, or having chemotherapy or radiation.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/blood-disorders/aplastic-anemia.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:33:26.371774', 'title': 'Aplastic Anemia - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Causes of aplastic anemia', 'super_section': None}"

Diagnosis often involves ruling out other illnesses such as leukemia or inherited bone marrow failure disorders. As soon as aplastic anemia is diagnosed, treatment is started.
Aplastic anemia is diagnosed based on your child’s medical history, physical exam, and lab tests. Lab tests for aplastic anemia may include:
Complete blood count (CBC)with reticulocytes (immature red blood cells) to measure the number and size of blood cells.

42,Warm AIHA is the most common form of primary AIHA in children. It makes up 60–90% of cases. It is called warm AIHA because antibodies attack red blood cells when blood is at normal body temperature or higher-than-normal body temperature.,"{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/blood-disorders/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-aiha.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:33:26.702672', 'title': 'Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia', 'super_section': None}"
43,"Cold AIHA is rare in children, making up about 10% of cases. If your provider suspects cold AIHA, they may order tests to measure antibodies that attack red blood cells at cold temperatures.
Types of cold disease include:
Cold agglutinin disease (CAD):CAD usually happens after infection withEpstein-Barr virusor a type of bacteria calledMycoplasma pneumoniae. It happens when the immune system attacks red blood cells when blood is at a lower-than-normal body temperature.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/blood-disorders/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-aiha.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:33:26.702672', 'title': 'Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'Cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia', 'super_section': None}"
44,"Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH or Donath-Landsteiner syndrome):PCH is a rare type of cold disease but it is more common in young children.

45,"Treatment for AIHA is based on the type (warm or cold) and severity of anemia. Not all children need treatment for AIHA. Many children recover on their own. Your care team may recommend monitoring or watchful waiting. The hematology team will check your child’s blood counts and symptoms to see when and if treatment is needed.

Stomach pain
Feeling more hungry than usual
Moodiness
Trouble sleeping
Flushing of the face
Weight gain, especially in the face and belly
Acne
High blood pressure
High blood sugar level
Increased risk of infection
Your child’s doctor may prescribe other medicines to help your child with side effects. Your child’s doctor will gradually decrease the dose of the steroids until they can be stopped completely.

127,"Hemophiliais a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly. It usually runs in families. But there are times a person may be the first one in their family to develop hemophilia.
Platelets are blood cells that help clot the blood. Certain proteins in the blood, calledclotting factors, help platelets stick together to form clots and stop bleeding. Hemophilia is caused by having little or no clotting factor. This means the blood does not clot fast enough when tissue is injured.
There are 12 clotting factors in the blood. Lacking even one of these clotting factors causes prolonged bleeding. Hemophilia is caused by a change (called a mutation) in a gene that provides instructions to proteins to form clots in the blood.","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/blood-disorders/hemophilia.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:34:25.672996', 'title': 'Hemophilia - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is hemophilia?', 'super_section': None}"

Petechiae: Tiny red or purple “pinpoint” dots on the skin that may look like a rash
Purpura:Red or purple spots on the skin caused by bleeding
Jaundice:A yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes
Unexplained bleeding or bruising
Paleness
Feeling tired or weak
Fever
Headache
Nausea or vomiting
Fast heart rate
Shortness of breath
Confusion, changes in speech, blurry vision, or seizure
A low amount of urine (pee) or protein or blood in your urine

339,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, inherited blood disorder that affects the bone marrow. It is a type of bone marrow failure where the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells.
Fanconi anemia can affect other body tissues and organs, including the bones, skin, kidneys, and heart. It can also increase the risk of certain types of cancer.
Bone marrow has blood-forming stem cells that become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
Bone marrowis the soft, spongy tissue at the center of your bones. Stem cells in the bone marrow make new blood cells. These include:
Red blood cellsthat carry oxygen to the body
White blood cellsthat help fight infections
Plateletsthat help the blood to clot and stop bleeding","{'source_url': 'https://together.stjude.org/en-us/conditions/blood-disorders/fanconi-anemia.html', 'retrieved_at': '2025-09-29T20:34:28.601327', 'title': 'Fanconi Anemia - Together by St. Jude™', 'section': 'What is Fanconi anemia?', 'super_section': None}"

White blood cells (neutropenia)
Platelets (thrombocytopenia)
People with Fanconi anemia may also developmyelodysplastic syndrome(MDS). In MDS, blood cells are damaged and do not develop or work normally.

Chickenpox can cause fever, poor appetite, and tiredness followed by an itchy rash. It is contagious from 1–2 days before the rash appears until the rash has dried up.
In most children, chickenpox is a mild illness and goes away on its own. But it can be a serious illness in a person who is immunocompromised (has a weak immune system).  Possible complications include skin infections,pneumonia, and brain swelling.
Chickenpox vaccination works very well to prevent the illness. Talk to your health care provider about the varicella vaccine.

The goal of ART is to get the amount of HIV in your body so low that the HIV virus does not show up on a blood test. If the amount of HIV is undetectable, it also may prevent transmission of HIV through sex. This may take being on ART for 3–6 months.
With lower amounts of HIV virus, the number of CD4 cells can increase so that the immune system works better.
